## Provence

Three different dynasties of counts ruled Provence during the Middle Ages, and Provence became a prize in the complex rivalries between the Catalan rulers of Barcelona, the kings of Burgundy, the German rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, and the Angevin kings of France.

The Bosonids (879–1112) were the descendants of the first king of Provence, Boson. His son, Louis the Blind (890–928) lost his sight trying to win the throne of Italy, after which his cousin, Hugh of Italy (died 947) became the Duke of Provence and the Count of Vienne. Hugh moved the capital of Provence from Vienne to Arles and made Provence a fief of Rudolph II of Burgundy.

In the 9th century, Arab pirates (called Saracens by the French) and then the Normans invaded Provence. The Normans pillaged the region and then left, but the Saracens built castles and began raiding towns and holding local residents for ransom. The conquering Arabs established the emirate of Fraxinet in 887. Early in 973, the Saracens captured Maieul, the abbot of the monastery at Cluny, and held him for ransom. The ransom was paid and the abbot was released, but the people of Provence, led by Count William I, rose up and defeated the Saracens near their most powerful fortress (La Garde-Freinet) at the Battle of Tourtour. The Saracens who were not killed in the battle were baptised and enslaved, and the remaining Saracens in Provence fled the region. Meanwhile, dynastic quarrels continued. A war between Rudolph III of Burgundy and his rival, German emperor Conrad the Salic led in 1032 to Provence becoming a fiefdom of the Holy Roman Empire, which it remained until 1246.

In 1112, the last descendant of Boson, Douce I, Countess of Provence, married the Catalan Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, who as a result became Raymond Berenguer I, Count of Provence. He ruled Provence from 1112 until 1131, and his descendants, the Catalan counts, ruled in Provence until 1246. In 1125, Provence was divided; the part of Provence north and west of the Durance river went to the Count of Toulouse, while the lands between the Durance and the Mediterranean, and from the Rhône river to the Alps, belonged to the counts of Provence. The capital of Provence was moved from Arles to Aix-en-Provence, and later to Brignoles.[22]

Under the Catalan counts, the 12th century saw the construction of important cathedrals and abbeys in Provence, in a harmonious new style, the Romanesque, which united the Gallo-Roman style of the Rhône Valley with the Lombard style of the Alps. Aix Cathedral was built on the site of the old Roman forum, and then rebuilt in the Gothic style in the 13th and 14th centuries. The Church of St. Trophime in Arles was a landmark of Romanesque architecture, built between the 12th and the 15th centuries. A vast fortress-like monastery, Montmajour Abbey, was built on an island just north of Arles and became a major destination for medieval pilgrims.

In the 12th century, three Cistercian monasteries were built in remote parts of Provence, far from the political intrigues of the cities. Sénanque Abbey was the first, established in the Luberon between 1148 and 1178. Thoronet Abbey was founded in a remote valley near Draguignan in 1160. Silvacane Abbey, on the Durance river at La Roque-d'Anthéron, was founded in 1175.

In the 13th century, the French kings started to use marriage to extend their influence into the south of France. One son of King Louis VIII "the Lion", Alphonse, Count of Poitou, married the heiress of the Count of Toulouse, Joan. Another, Louis IX "the Saint" of France or Saint Louis (1214–1270), married Marguerite of Provence. Then, in 1246, Charles, Count of Anjou, the youngest son of Louis VIII, married the heiress of Provence, Beatrice. Provence's fortunes became tied to the Angevin Dynasty and the Kingdom of Naples.[23]

## Albigensian Crusade

Cruzada Albigence, em Português

The Albigensian Crusade or the Cathar Crusade (French: Croisade des albigeois; 1209–1229) was a military and ideological campaign initiated by Pope Innocent III to eliminate Catharism in Languedoc, what is now southern France. The Crusade was prosecuted primarily by the French crown and promptly took on a political aspect. It resulted in the significant reduction of practicing Cathars and a realignment of the County of Toulouse with the French crown. The distinct regional culture of Languedoc was also diminished.

- **1229** - The Franco-Provençal war was largely a discontinuous series of skirmishes and, in January 1229, Raymond VII, defeated, was forced to sign the [Treaty of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1229) "Treaty of Paris (1229)") (also known as the "Treaty of Meaux"). By this treaty he ceded the former viscounty of [Trencavel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trencavel "Trencavel") to [Louis IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_IX_of_France "Louis IX of France") and his daughter [Joan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Toulouse "Joan of Toulouse") was forced to marry [Alphonse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse,_Count_of_Poitiers "Alphonse, Count of Poitiers"), brother of the king.
- **c. 1230-1245: Consolidation under Ramon Berenguer V.**  - The Count of Provence, Ramon Berenguer V of the House of Barcelona, spends these years consolidating his authority. He is the first count in a century to reside permanently in Provence, primarily in Aix-en-Provence. He actively works to bring the powerful and independent cities of Arles and Marseille under his control, facing resistance from local nobles and the citizenry who cherish their autonomy.
- **1234** - Beginning of Provençal Inquisitions; **A Royal Marriage.** The first of Ramon Berenguer V's four daughters, Margaret of Provence, marries the pious and powerful King Louis IX of France. This prestigious match signals the rising political importance of Provence and begins to tie its fate more closely to the French kingdom.
- **1236: A Second Royal Marriage.** The count's second daughter, Eleanor of Provence, is married to King Henry III of England. This union further elevates the status of the Provençal court and places Ramon Berenguer V's daughters at the center of European power politics, though it also creates a rivalry between the French and English courts.
- **1243: A Third Great Match.** The third daughter, Sanchia of Provence, marries Richard of Cornwall, brother of King Henry III of England and one of the wealthiest men in Europe. He would later be elected King of the Romans (King of Germany).
- **August 19, 1245: The Death of a Count.** Ramon Berenguer V dies in Aix-en-Provence. Having no sons, he bequeaths the County of Provence to his youngest and unmarried daughter, Beatrice, in his will. This choice overrides any claims by his other daughters and their powerful husbands, ensuring Provence remains a unified and independent county.
- **January 31, 1246: The Angevin Era Begins.** Beatrice of Provence marries Charles d'Anjou, the ambitious and youngest brother of King Louis IX of France. With this marriage, Charles becomes the Count of Provence. This marks the end of Catalan rule and the beginning of the Angevin dynasty's control over the county, a turning point in Provençal history that irrevocably shifts its alignment towards the French sphere of influence.
- **1246-1250: The Struggle for Authority.** Charles d'Anjou immediately begins to centralize power and assert his feudal rights with a vigor unfamiliar to the independent-minded cities and nobles of Provence. His attempts to impose his authority and levy taxes lead to widespread discontent and a series of revolts, particularly in the proud cities of Marseille, Arles, and Avignon, which resist the loss of their long-held autonomy.
- **1248: Departure on Crusade.** As a man of his station and time, Count Charles d'Anjou and his wife Beatrice join his brother, King Louis IX, on the Seventh Crusade to Egypt. He entrusts the governance of the restive county to his officials.
- **1250: Return and Suppression.** Upon his return to Provence from the Crusade, Charles finds the region in open rebellion. He begins a determined and often harsh campaign to subdue the rebellious cities and nobles, laying the groundwork to finally break their independence in the years to come.
- **1250-1252: The First War of the Baussenque (Guerre Baussenque).** Upon his return from the Crusade, Charles I of Anjou begins a systematic campaign to crush the rebellion against him. The lords of Baux lead a coalition of Provençal nobles and the cities of Arles, Avignon, and Marseille. By 1252, Charles, with military and financial support from his brother King Louis IX, successfully puts down this major revolt. He forces the cities to recognize his authority, though Marseille retains a significant degree of its cherished autonomy for a time.
- **1257: Marseille Submits.** Charles I finally brings the proud and powerful city of Marseille more firmly under his control. He forces the city to dismantle its outer walls, accept a royal _viguier_ (a judicial and administrative officer), and acknowledge his lordship, though the city's spirit of independence is far from extinguished.
- **1262: The Final Revolt of Marseille.** Provoked by Charles's increasing authoritarianism and taxation for his Italian ambitions, Marseille revolts one last time, led by the nobleman Boniface VI de Castellane and Hugh of Baux.
- **1263: The Fall of Marseille.** Charles I, now preparing for a far grander prize, besieges Marseille by land and sea. The city capitulates, and this time, the suppression is final. Charles executes many of the rebel leaders, revokes all of the city's privileges and autonomous governance, and builds two new fortresses to ensure its permanent submission. The age of Marseille as a quasi-independent city-state is over.
- **1266: The Conquest of Sicily.** Having pacified Provence, Charles I pursues his greatest ambition. With the Pope's blessing, he invades Southern Italy, defeats and kills the Hohenstaufen ruler Manfred at the Battle of Benevento, and is crowned King of Sicily and Naples. Provence now becomes a crucial strategic and financial resource for Charles's vast new Mediterranean kingdom.
- **1282: The Sicilian Vespers.** The populace of Sicily rebels violently against the rule of Charles I and his French officials in an uprising known as the Sicilian Vespers. Peter III of Aragon, whose wife Constance is the daughter of the former king Manfred, lands on the island and is proclaimed King. This event triggers a massive, prolonged war that will consume the resources of the Angevin dynasty.
- **1283-1284: War Effort and Repression.** The War of the Sicilian Vespers has a direct impact on Provence. Charles I levies heavy taxes and recruits troops from the county to fuel his war effort against the Aragonese. This leads to renewed tensions and unrest.
- **January 7, 1285: The Death of a King-Count.** Charles I of Anjou dies in Foggia, Italy, his dreams of a Mediterranean empire shattered by the Sicilian Vespers. He is succeeded as Count of Provence and King of Naples by his son, Charles II. However, Charles II is a prisoner of the Aragonese at the time of his father's death.
- **1288: The Liberation of Charles II.** After years of captivity, Charles II is finally released by the King of Aragon. He arrives in Provence and is formally acclaimed as Count in Aix-en-Provence. His reign is marked by a more conciliatory and diplomatic approach than his father's.
- **c. 1290-1300: A Period of Relative Peace and Consolidation.** Having seen the consequences of his father's costly wars, Charles II spends much of his reign consolidating his power in his remaining domains of Naples and Provence. In Provence, he eases some of the harsher policies of his father, seeking to govern through more traditional feudal relationships rather than by absolute force. This period sees relative stability and economic recovery in the county.
- **1295: The Peace of Anagni.** This treaty formally attempts to settle the conflict over Sicily. While complex and ultimately not fully successful in the long term, it confirms Charles II as King of Naples and solidifies his position, allowing him to focus more on governance.
- **1297: Avignon Becomes Papal Territory.** Charles II sells his rights over the city of Avignon to the Papacy. While Avignon was part of the Marquisate of Provence (which had belonged to the Papacy since 1229), the Counts of Provence still held significant rights there. This act further cements the Papal presence in the region, setting the stage for one of the most significant events of the next decade: the move of the Papal court from Rome to Avignon in 1309.
