## Future

- **1233 - The Price of a Soul:** 
    - **Hook:** The demon with whom Caesar (Nicolau) made a deal in 977 has been patient. It, or one of its spawn, finally comes to inspect its "investment." It does not arrive with fire and brimstone, but perhaps as a charming merchant, a desperate refugee, or a whispering presence in the dreams of the covenfolk.
    - **Development:** The entity begins subtly corrupting one of the covenant's vis sources or attempting to influence a vulnerable member of the covenant. It may not seek to destroy Mons Clara, but to use its resources or claim one of its magi as the "interest" on its long-overdue debt. This directly engages with the foundational lore of your saga.
- **1234 - The Queen's Favor:**
    - **Hook:** The historical marriage of Margaret of Provence to King Louis IX of France occurs. This is the single greatest political event of the decade in Provence.
    - **Development:** Through a courtly connection (perhaps via House Jerbiton), Mons Clara is asked to provide a subtle service. It could be a magical "blessing" for the royal couple's journey, an enchantment on a wedding gift, or a quiet investigation to ensure no rival lord or hostile mage attempts to magically sabotage the proceedings. Success could earn the covenant a powerful, if secret, royal ally; failure could bring the wrath of two kingdoms down upon them.
- **1236 - The Inquisitor's Shadow:**
    - **Hook:** The Papal Inquisition, now firmly established, becomes more active in the remote valleys of Provence, seeking out lingering Cathar and Waldensian (Weldenian) sympathizers.
    - **Development:** An ambitious and magically-aware Dominican Inquisitor is assigned to the region. He may notice a "unnatural" lack of heresy and divine disquiet in the lands around Mons Clara. He begins a slow, careful investigation, not of the magi directly, but of the covenfolk and the lands they manage. The covenant must use all its subtlety to misdirect him without revealing themselves or sacrificing the heretical refugees they took in back in 1219.
- **1240 - The Rival's Discovery:**
    - **Hook:** A rival covenant (perhaps from the Italian or Greater Alps tribunals) stumbles upon a piece of Nicolau's hidden history. They might find an ancient text describing Caesar's golem-body, or capture and interrogate a minor spirit that witnessed the demonic pact.
    - **Development:** This rival doesn't go to the Quaesitors—the information is too valuable. They begin a campaign of blackmail against Mons Clara. They demand vis, magical items, or political concessions at the next Tribunal, all under the threat of revealing Nicolau's unnatural and diabolical origins. The player characters must decide whether to pay the price, destroy the rival, or risk having the covenant's founder declared a diabolist.
- **1245 - The End of an Era:**
    - **Hook:** The historical death of Count Ramon Berenguer V. He leaves Provence not to his royal daughters, but to his youngest, Beatrice. This triggers a crisis.
    - **Development:** Before Charles d'Anjou's arrival in 1246, Provence is in a state of uncertainty. Ambitious local lords may try to seize land. The king of France and the king of England may send agents to press their wives' claims. The magi of Mons Clara could find themselves caught in the middle of these power plays, forced to back a side or defend their own lands from opportunistic mundane armies. This sets the stage perfectly for the dramatic changes of the 1250s.
