Appearance: The wolf has erect, triangular ears, a narrow muzzle, and a coat of shaggy fur. Its eyes are usually yellowish and have a steady, unsettling gaze. Its color may be any shade from pale grey through dark brown, often with lighter patches on the sides of the face and around the eyes. The wolf can bark, but its better-known sound is its eerie, piercing howl. 

The wolf is found throughout Mythic Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.  According to Pliny the Elder, the wolves of northern regions are fierce while those of Africa and Egypt are weak

Wolves are greatly feared by commoners. They are hunted with large hounds because they kill livestock. In some lands, there is a bounty on their hides. Many tales attribute supernatural powers to wolves, but most wolves are mundane and have no powers at all. 

The Flaws above reflect the medieval perception of the wolf as a wanton, bloodthirsty killer. Individual wolves, such as the Animal Companion of a player character, may substitute another Personality Flaw in place of the Compulsion. A wolf Animal Companion that goes around killing livestock could be disruptive to stories. Regardless of such a wolf's actual personality, mundanes are likely to treat it with a great deal of fear and suspicion.

The leader of a wolf pack has the additional Ability, Leadership 5 (wolves). A pack may fight as a trained group when its leader is present. A wolf pack is extremely dangerous.
