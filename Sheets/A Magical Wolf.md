Powers:
_Pack of One_, 2 points, Init +10, Animal: The wolf can create five duplicates of himself, who can then fight as a trained group. For these purposes, treat the wolf as having a Leadership score of 5, so that he can get the full +15 group bonus to his attacks. The power lasts until the pack brings
down its opponent, which may be a group, or disengages from the fight. As the pack is really all one creature, the nomination of a vanguard is arbitrary. Further, the group does not need to disengage and reform when the vanguard is killed; it can seamlessly transfer the role to another wolf. Finally, the wolf only dies if all the copies are killed. When the duplicates vanish, the least wounded wolf remains.
_Terrifying Howl_, 4 points, Init +0, Mentem: Anyone who hears the wolf’s howl is struck with fear of the wolf and of wilderness places away from the haunts of men. Someone already in a house will merely not want to leave. Overcoming this fear completely requires a Brave roll against an Ease Factor of 12. Acting sensibly while responding to it, such as heading back to the village carefully, requires a Brave roll against an Ease Factor of 6. Those who fail the easier roll simply flee in panic.
_Wolf Lord_, 0 points, constant, Animal: Any wolf the magical wolf strikes in deadly combat dies instantly. In addition, the magical wolf can make mundane wolves follow his instructions even when he is not around, as long as the instructions are quite simple.
Equipment: None. Magical though he is, he is still a wolf.
Encumbrance: 0 (0)
Vis: 4 pawns of Animal, in head.
Appearance: A gray male wolf, slightly larger than normal, but only slightly, and looking extremely healthy. His eyes, in particular, sparkle more brightly than should be possible.

The magical wolf does not care for such human niceties as names, and isn’t particularly interested in human beings. Instead, he watches over all the wolves in his range, doing what he can to ensure
their safety, health, and food supply. Sometimes, this means hunting wolves down himself, to keep population down, and in that case he removes the weak from the packs.
While he has no interest in human beings, he does see that they are important, and might be willing to negotiate with a village. On the other hand, he might decide to drive them out. This
magical wolf has the same reactions to The Gift as a mundane animal, although other magical wolves may not.
