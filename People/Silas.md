Let us name this fae lord **Silas**, though it is but one name he has used. He is not a lord of combat or of grand armies, but a connoisseur, a collector of that which is most precious and intangible.
### The Nature of the Fae Lord, Silas

Silas is an ancient fae whose being is tied to memory and sensation. Think of him not as a vampire feeding on blood, but as a sommelier tasting the finest of wines. To him, the peak moments of human experience—a first kiss, the pride of a victory, a shared laugh, a moment of sublime creation—are the most exquisite vintages in existence. His purpose is not to cause suffering, but to collect and savor these perfect, fleeting moments. The withering of the family de Valeray is, to him, an unfortunate but necessary consequence of his harvest, much as a vintner thinks little of the pressed grape.

**Appearance and Demeanor:**

- **Within his Regio:** In his own domain, Silas appears as a being of polished, ancient heartwood, shaped like a tall, slender man. Veins of glowing amber pulse beneath the surface, and within them swirl motes of captured light—each a stolen moment of joy. His voice is calm and melodic, but resonates with an unnerving lack of empathy.
- **In the Mundane World:** Should he deign to walk the manor's halls, he takes a less conspicuous form: a quiet, impeccably dressed man who seems to absorb the light around him. He might appear as a scribe, a distant cousin, or even a child. His stillness is his most unnerving quality; he does not fidget, his gaze does not wander, and he moves with an unnatural silence.

**Personality:** Silas is the epitome of ancient patience and politeness. He will converse with the magi as equals, showing genuine curiosity about their art and their experiences. He speaks of the de Valeray family's plight with a detached sympathy, as one might speak of a fine vineyard suffering a poor season. He adheres to the letter of any bargain with absolute strictness and expects the same in return. He is not cruel in his intent, but his complete inability to comprehend human values makes him profoundly dangerous. He might ask a magus to describe the feeling of successfully completing a complex ritual, not to learn the magic, but to vicariously taste their pride.

### The Domain: The Museum of Moments

The fae regio tied to the manor is not a dark forest or glittering palace in the traditional sense. It is Silas's collection. One might call it the "Museum of Moments" or the "Orchard of Memories."

- **The Entrance:** The gateway to the regio is a gnarled, ancient olive tree in a forgotten corner of the manor's gardens. A knot in its trunk vaguely resembles a face frozen in a silent laugh. The knot becomes a shimmering portal under specific conditions—perhaps at twilight when a heartfelt laugh is uttered nearby, or when someone sheds a tear of genuine sorrow.
- **The Landscape:** The regio is a silent forest of crystalline trees. The air is still and smells of dust and old parchment. Instead of leaves, these trees bear crystal fruit, and suspended within each is a perfect, frozen tableau: a young de Valeray boy holding a wooden sword aloft in triumph; the face of a bride seeing her love; an old man smiling peacefully at his first great-grandchild. These are the stolen moments, preserved forever. The only light comes from a soft, internal glow from within these crystals.
- **Inhabitants:** Besides Silas, the regio is populated by "Echoes"—faint, translucent figures who silently re-enact the stolen moments, playing the parts of the de Valeray ancestors. They are harmless, but deeply sorrowful to watch. Tiny "Glimmer-Moths" with wings of faint light flutter from crystal to crystal, feeding on the residual emotional energy.

### The Bargain's Twisted History

The original pact is the key to this story.

- **The Ancestor:** Centuries ago, during a time of famine and war, Lady Seraphina de Valeray, a woman of formidable will, sought a magical solution to save her collapsing house. She ventured into the old woods and found Silas.
- **The Wording:** Desperate, she struck a bargain. In exchange for lasting prosperity, the House de Valeray would grant Silas, on the new moon of each month, a tithe of "the finest vintage their demesne produces." (A melhor colheita que o seu domínio produz)
- **The Twist:** For the first generation, the family brought Silas the finest cask of wine from their cellars. Silas accepted this. But he grew bored. Citing the pact's exact words, he argued that the wine was merely a product of the land, but the _truest_ and _finest_ vintage produced by the people living on that land was their own emotion. Bound by the magic of the fae bargain, the family could not refute his logic. The tithe changed from wine to joy. At first it was a small thing—a happy memory given willingly. Over generations, as the family's spirit weakened, Silas's collection became more aggressive, plucking moments from their minds without their consent, leaving them ever more hollow.
    

This history provides your players with levers. Can they find the original, written pact hidden in the manor's chapel or library? Is there a loophole in the phrase "their demesne produces"? Could they argue that a work of art, a poem, or a masterful song is a "finer vintage" than a simple emotion? Or can they offer Silas a new, more intoxicating vintage—the thrill of Hermetic magic, perhaps—to lure him into a new bargain and release the family de Valeray from their centuries-old curse?
