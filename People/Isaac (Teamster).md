Notes
You are one of the best teamsters of the covenant, because you acquired a lot of skill in dealing with people while traveling around the region. You have seen the magi, and are used to their Gift.
Your background is as a travelling peddler or something similar, because you have the necessary skills to travel to new places, deal with new people, and sell them things. You are very good at understanding people, and at either charming them or lying to them. You probably used to travel in groups, because you can only try to intimidate physical threats. Your Survival score is low, but the Ease Factors for tasks on well-used routes also tend to be low, and rolls are rarely necessary, and so it is enough to make you a competent traveller, if you stick to the standard routes.

You have a very high score in Occitan. This means that you can communicate fluently with
speakers of any dialect of Occitan, and also with speakers of Burgundian, Catalan, French, and
Lingua Franca. Faith and Flame, page 20, has details of the languages spoken in this area, but you
have an effective score of at least 5, meaning that you can communicate fluently, in all of those
languages. You are also functional in Euskara, the Basque language. If you encounter people from
outside the region, you can assume that you are functional (effective score of 4) with speakers of
Latin and other Romance languages, like languages spoken in the Italian northern Iberian
peninsulas, and with speakers of Anglo-Norman, the language of the noble classes in the British
Isles. Unless you leave the tribunal, you are very unlikely to encounter someone with whom you
cannot communicate — regular travellers from lands where other languages are spoken are likely
to have learned something local.

You also have a very low score in Order of Hermes Lore. However, because you have put
experience points into it, you can use the Ability. You do know something about the Order of
Hermes, but not very much at all. This probably means that you have not been associated with a
covenant for very long.
