In the Summer of 1220 he visited Mons Clara: He wants payment from destroyed itens. He is asking £30 and 10 pawns of vis. He is being a bully, but also sending a message to Cenobium.

While he avoided direct confrontation, the young magi did not provide payment. He will bring the issue to the next Tribunal and actively seek a _Causa Belli_ for a Wizard's War.

He will return from the Roman Tribunal in 1222-1223, but with an Aegis, he will seek a less protection situation. He does contact the `The Forest Hags` to his cause.

### The Agenda of Tres (the Rusticani Zealot)

Tres's entire purpose is the protection of the mundane populace, a philosophy that puts him in constant friction with the Order's laws of non-interference. He views the suffering of the common folk from the drought and the Crusade as a direct failure of the Order of Hermes, which selfishly hoards its power.

1. **To Demand Magical Famine & Drought Relief:** The call for Herbam vis is, to him, a pathetic and insulting token. He will bring a motion to _compel_ covenants to use their power _directly_ to aid the populace. He will demand that magi of Creo and Aquam be assigned to perform rituals to create food and bring rain to the afflicted regions, arguing that hoarding such power in a time of suffering is a moral crime. This motion will be wildly unpopular, seen as a gross overreach of Tribunal authority and a waste of vis and lab time.
    
2. **To Shame the Tribunal into Action on the Crusade:** He voted "SIM" (Yes) to combat the crusaders, not for political reasons, but to stop the _slaughter_. He will bring graphic, firsthand accounts of burned villages, murdered peasants, and salted fields. He will publicly name the covenants that voted "NÃO" or abstained (like Aedes Mercurii and Stella Durus) and accuse them of "fiddling while Occitania burns," demanding they justify their inaction in the face of such human misery.
    
3. **To Investigate Mundane Welfare at Tolosa Paratge:** He cares nothing for the political schism of the magi. He will demand to know how the common folk are faring. Are the feuding magi neglecting their tenants? Is their conflict causing starvation or danger to their covenfolk? He may move to send a Quaesitor (or himself) to investigate the _mundane_ conditions of the covenant, bypassing the magi's dispute entirely.
    
4. **To Censure Magi for Mundane Endangerment:** He will be listening for _any_ story of a magus whose actions have harmed mundanes. This could be anything from the "Poached Apprentice" dispute (accusing the magus of ruining a young man's life) to Calais's complaint about the river (accusing Coenobium of drying up peasant wells downstream). He is a social justice warrior in an age that has no name for it.

### The Conflict with Mons Clara & Drusilla

This is where the tragedy lies. Tres would see a fellow Ex Miscellanea, one with hedge magic roots, as a _natural ally_. He would _want_ Drusilla to be on his side. The conflict arises when he discovers _how_ she interacts with the mundane world, for her methods are anathema to his.

The core of the conflict is the **Gentle Gift** and the **Cult of Dama**.

**1. The "Poison" of the Gentle Gift:** To Tres, mundanes are not sheep to be protected. They are people, with wills of their own, who deserve _true_ guardianship.

- **Tres's Method:** He would use his magic (perhaps charms or wards) to protect a village, and his _words_ (Leadership, Folk Ken) to rally them, earn their _genuine_ trust, and help them stand on their own. He wants them to _love_ him, or at least _respect_ him, as a real person.
    
- **Drusilla's Method:** The Gentle Gift _forces_ passivity. It _dulls_ their fear, their anger, their suspicion... their _will_. It makes them _pliant_.
    

When Tres sees this, he will be horrified. He will not see protection; he will see a _despicable, magical slavery_. He will see a magus who, fearing the honest and difficult work of earning trust, simply _cheats_ and drugs them into compliance.

**2. The Cult of the Matrons:** Tres fights _against_ unjust power structures (nobles, crusaders, indifferent magi). Drusilla has just _joined_ one.

He is far more likely than other magi to have seen Dama's cult in action at the village level. He will not see a benevolent sisterhood; he will see a _secret society_ that demands obedience, extracts tithes (vis/loyalty), and manipulates the very people he is sworn to protect. It is just a _new tyranny_ replacing the old.

If he catches even the _faintest_ scent of Maju's Infernal influence—a warped ritual, a feeling of dread, a "price" for the cult's blessings—his crusade will find its ultimate target.

**The Confrontation:** Tres will not challenge Drusilla to a magical duel. He will put her on a _moral_ trial.

He will find her in a public space, perhaps as she speaks to a mundane servant who is clearly under the effect of her Gift.

- **The Accusation:** "Sodalis Drusilla! You, a daughter of Miscellanea, who should know the worth of the common heart! How _dare_ you?"
    
- **He will point to the servant:** "Look at this! This is not trust! This is not loyalty! This is a _leash_. You have taken her will and replaced it with this... _calm_. You are a _thief_ of the soul, no better than a demon who offers a poisoned bargain."
    
- **The Political Strike:** "And you do this in service to Dama's little club of 'Matrons'! You blunt the people's minds so they will bow to your new mistress! You are not protecting them; you are _grooming_ them for your master!"
    

This attack is devastating. It puts Drusilla at odds with her own House's ideals (if she shares them). It forces her to defend a manipulative, mind-affecting power. And it publicly links her to Dama's cult, painting both as _enemies of the people_, which is the one charge Tres truly cares about.
