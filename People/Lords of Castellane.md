- In 1248, he and Barral of Baux led a rebellion against Charles of Anjou (Count of Provence and son of Louis VIII of France), who was gone on the Seventh Crusade. Charles suppressed the uprising after he returned in 1250.
- Bonifaci's turbulent political career can be traced through his three surviving sirventes, lyric poetic works on political themes in the Occitan language, each written at different points in his conflict with Charles of Anjou.
- The pact between Charles and several cities of Piedmont in 1260 provoked another violent poem in the style of Bertran de Born, Gerra e trebailh e brega.m plaz. Early in 1262, Bonifaci led another revolt in the city of Marseille against Charles' rule. This time Barral of Baux remained loyal to Charles, but his cousin Hugh of Baux joined Bonifaci. In response, Charles destroyed Castellane and forced Bonifaci into exile.
- He fled to the court of James I at Montpellier. There he penned Sitot no m'es fort gaya la sazos, identical in metre and rhyme scheme with Humils e francs e fis soplei ves vos by Pons de Capduelh. From Montpellier he continued into Spain, where he was at Huesca in February 1265, at the court of the infante Peter the Great, arranging an alliance against Charles. He was at Valencia in July, but after that he disappears from the sources and probably died soon after.
