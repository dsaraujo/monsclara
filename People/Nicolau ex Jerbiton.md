Jovius was a Bonisagus (the founder) fili, that went through apprenticeship in four years, but commited many breaches of the Code, and was marched in 812 by the Founder himself. However, he was not permanently killed. He stayed in Germania as a ghost, and eventually possessed a child with the Gift, a woman named Herlinde. Completely overriding her personality and mind, Jovius joined the Order again as Helga ex Miscellanea in 857.

Helga/Jovius was obsessed with two things: guaranteeing its immortality, and extracting revenge against Bonisagus and his decendents. Around 899, after the 7th Great Tribunal, they prepared a new body that they build using non-Hermetic magic, half Golem, and transferred their personality/soul inside of it. However, this body could not grow, and it was unnaturally immutable. Known as Ceasar, they avoided the Order of Hermes from 900 until 970, living in the border of the Tribunals. Caesar already resembled the image of Nicolau and Benoit.

In 970, Caesar hits a breakthrough, and it is able to construct a human body that could work as a receptacle of his full soul and mind. But they can't transport The Gift, and looks for a strong magic location to hope to imbue the body with enough magic to awaken the gift, using ancient Diedne magic (and likely Infernal-tainted). After 7 years, the body is ready, and Nicolau is born as a baby, but with the Intellect and Soul of Jovius.

Using his extensive network, Nicolau is able to get raised as an apprentice of the House Jerbiton. His Gift is gentle, and he is a perfect charmer. His presence in the Normandy, then Provençal Tribunals, is extensive. Magi over 160 in 1220 have known him, but the list is small: only Ophilio Ex Mercere and Dama ex Merinita.

In 1115, Nicolau is ready to make a new descendent, even better. He gets a big sum of vis from Mons Clara and goes to a retreat in the Alps. In two years, he prepares three babies, but in the process of trying to find a way to transfer his spirit with his soul, he bargained with a demon, and got locked in an Infernal régio being tortured (for 80 years) until 1195. Leaving, he drops the babies in three different tribunals and goes on a vengeance quest on the Infernal regio. He did succeed on copying his gift, but he is waiting for the babies to grow to transfer his mind and soul.

One of the babies is a intelligent one, sent to East Germania. It was killed due to the Gift and as a rivalry of Augustus ex Tytalus. Another had a very promising gift (Focus Self), and it is send back to Miniata Sophia ([Benoit ex Criamon](Benoit%20ex%20Criamon.md)). The third one, a girl, was send to Stonehenge to be trained as a Jerbiton, also with a Gentle Gift. It is Jovious main focus.

Inside the secret lab, there are the lab notes (on Jovius/Nicolau's own notes) for the following spells:

**The Vitruvian' s Gift**
Creo Corpus 20 (Ritual)
R: Touch D: Mom T: Ind
Creates a new complete baby at any age. This spell was an experimentation and always creates a copy of the caster's body. The spell also contains a restriction to only be cast during an eclipse. In Nicolau's version of this spell, the scalp of the body contains geometrical shapes.
(Base 5, Touch +1, Level 20 minimum for a ritual)

**The Creator's Touch**
Creo (Rego) Corpus 50 (Ritual)
R: Touch D: Mom T: Ind
Creates a full body out of a part of such body. The Rego requisite allows the body to be of any age equals or younger than the part's age. In Nicolau's version of this spell, the scalp of the body contains geometrical shapes.
(Base 40, Touch +1, Requisite +1)

**The Exact Copy of the Mind**
Intellego Creo Mentem Vim 35 (Ritual)
R: Touch D: Mom T: Ind
Creates a copy of a mind, but no soul or spirit. The mind have all the knowledge and the memories of the original mind. This spell was an experimentation and will copy the Gift if the original mind/soul had one (significant side benefit).
(Base 25, non-hermetic, Touch+1, Requisite +1)

**Aging the Babe**: Level 50 Creo Corpus(Mentem) (Ritual)
R: Touch, T: Ind, D: Mom
Ages a newborn to five years old over the cause of a single day; they gain a score of 4 in their native language, and 30 experience in skills of their choice.
Due to the experimentation required for its creation this ritual only works if cast within a single moon of the babe's birth (restriction), but it doesn't count towards their age for the sake of aging rolls (significant side benefit).
The researcher behind it is attempting to create a spell to instill knowledge in an adult subject, but so far she's only been able to make it work alongside the earliest stage of physical maturation.
(Base 30, +1 touch, +1 requisite)

The magical creature left behind to take care of the bodies knows a little bit. Their name is Ahrimane, and they are a big flying eye with wings. Corrupted by the Infernal aura of the lab, they are now half-mad and needs blood to survive.

Ahrimane knows that their master is back, but doesn't know much. He remembers that the master left in 1195 (31 years ago, and more than 10,000 days) carrying three babies, that he called Idis, Egon and Suprecia. The first one was all mind, the second all self, and third one all him.
