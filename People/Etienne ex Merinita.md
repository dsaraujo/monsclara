With Luc since the beginning through a chance fostering, Etienne is primarily responsible for the maintenance and administration of Ara Maxima Nova as well as for interactions with visitors. An Animal, Herbam, Muto and Rego specialist, he contributes by keeping the structures in superior condition with an almost obsessive attention to detail.

Stocky and taciturn with dark features and a piercing gaze, Etienne is a former lover of Luc, but ended the relationship when Luc married Miriam. While he is an active member of the cult, he has no desire to seek its innermost secrets. Rather, he wants to remain close to Luc and support the mystagogue’s search for wisdom in anyway possible. Blessed with the Gentle Gift, he has a weakness for sweets and a good game of chess, often making excuses to enter Perpignan looking for both. Outside specific cult initiations, Etienne remains celibate and makes no effort to seek companionship.

He does feel the time is right to begin training an apprentice, and intends to search for one very soon.

Despite occasional arguments about the practice, Etienne even supplements some personnel needs with slaves from Arab merchants.

Etienne's letter states that:

- He misses Mons Clara dearly, and have fond memories of baths in the Roman Villa Baths, and the amazing bakery and ale produced by the covenfolk.
    
- He remembers his apprenticeship well. Julius was a fair teacher, but his dedication was more to his research than a proper training. Etienne felt Julius really only wanted a laboratory assistant. However, he did teach him the mystery of Dream Magic.
    
- Julius was less interested in dreams and more about the hidden powers of the mind. Dreaming was just an easy way of fully accessing his own mind and the mind of others. He despised the experiences inside dreams, which he considered mere "fabrications out of glamour" and far from a real experience in Arcadia or the mundane world.
    
- Etienne knows more about the lab and Julius, but he is afraid of sharing mysteries of the House via correspondence.
    
- Unfortunately Etienne own interests do not include the deeper secrets of dreams, but he can certainly arrange being your mystagogue for Dream Magic, and it is eager to to arrange for your visit as a guest to Ara Maxima Nova as a full gauntleted magi.

Extra info:

"The Orb" was created to easily access one's one mind. The space inside the mind is not part of dreaming (it can easily access the dreaming), but a stable area inside the mind of the user. It functions as a Memory Palace, or similar Mental Construct. Julius would cast a spell to bring Etienne along to help in his lab, otherwise she would appear on her own space. Julius was researching a way of adding his mental construct permanently on his mind instead of depending on the Orb, but Etienne apprenticeship ended before that.

Letter:

Dearest Sodales Penelope of the House Merinita,

I hope this letter finds you all in good health and spirits. As I sit here in my personal sanctum, my thoughts drift back to the beloved halls of my apprenticeship covenant, the comforting warmth of the Roman Villa Baths, and the heavenly aroma of freshly baked bread from the bakery. Oh, and of course, the robust and heartening ales crafted by our skilled covenfolk! How I long for those simple pleasures.

Memories of my apprenticeship with Julius flood my mind. He was undoubtedly a fair teacher, a magus of considerable intellect. Yet, his heart lay primarily in his research, leaving me feeling more like a dutiful laboratory assistant than a true apprentice. However, I will always be grateful for the opportunity he afforded me to delve into the profound mystery of Dream Magic.

Though Julius harbored disdain for what he deemed mere "fabrications of glamour" within the realm of dreams, he recognized their potential as a means to unlock the latent power of the mind. Dreaming, for him, was but a tool to traverse the landscapes of consciousness, of his own and that of others. Such aims were far removed from the wonders of Arcadia or the tangible experiences of our world.

My knowledge of Julius's work and the secrets entrusted to me within the depths of his laboratory extends far beyond what I can comfortably put to paper. To divulge the mysteries of House Merinita in this manner would be a betrayal I am unwilling to commit.

My own path has strayed from the deeper exploration of dreams, though their potential intrigues me. Should your own heart yearn for such knowledge, I would be honored to serve as your mystagogue to Dream Magic. Moreover, I would be delighted to arrange for your visit to Ara Maxima Nova, welcoming you with the full rights and privileges of a gauntleted magus.

Until we meet again, may your days be filled with the pursuit of arcane wisdom and the joys of our Order.

With enduring respect and fondness,

Etienne of House Merinita

Ara Maxima Nova
