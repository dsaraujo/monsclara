Notes
You are a shield grog at the covenant, hired in the expansion of the guard by Badr. You take your responsibility very, very seriously, To be honest, a bit more seriously than you should. After a few unfortunate incidents in which you started fights that were probably unnecessary, you also learned to scare people into leaving you and the magi alone, although you are not as good at that as at fighting. 

One reason why you stick close to the magi is that animals really, really don’t like you. You have no idea why, although you do not like them much, either, but dogs want to bite you, horses want to kick you, and even chickens mob you and drive you from the yard. Back home, people started whispering that you were cursed, or a witch. You got into a few fights, and learned to look after yourself, but it became clear that the best option was to leave. You saw a Hermetic magus, and the animals were treating him the same way they treat you. You offered your services, and soon found yourself employed as a guard.

As long as you stay close to a magus or maga, no-one at the covenant realises that there is anything strange about you. They assume that the animals are reacting to the maga, not to you. That means that they treat you as normal. But you will only be allowed to stay near the magi as long as you succeed in protecting them from danger. And so it is very, very important that you protect whichever magus or maga you are assigned to at a particular time. 

You also like troubadour poetry, and make an effort to pick up news about troubadours in the area. This is really just a hobby; when you get drunk, though, you sing the songs — badly. (But not absolutely terribly. Just complete amateur with no talent or training. People can tell what you are trying to sing.)
