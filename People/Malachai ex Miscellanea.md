Carta de Penelope em 1227:

Dearest Malachai ex Miscellanea, I hope this letter finds you well and in good spirits. I am honored and grateful to have received your correspondence. Your mention of the Volshebnii Mechtateli has stirred both curiosity and admiration in me, as I have heard only faint whispers of this enigmatic group and the incredible legacy of Raisa ex Miscellanea. Her introduction of Dream Magic to the Order is a profound achievement and I hold her contributions in the highest regard. 

Dreams have always been a part of me, shaping not only my experiences but also my understanding of the world. For the first nine years of my life, I lived entirely within dreams, bound in a faerie regio of endless night. Even now, years after leaving that place, I feel more at home in the dream realm than in the waking world. 

This affinity for dreams extends into my Hermetic work. I have learned the Mystery of Dream Magic and the art of altering a dream to include an aware spirit. My magical talents naturally incline toward sleep and dreams, and I have found that working in a dream space is not only more comfortable for me but also more productive. The fluidity of dreams offers a realm unbound by the limits of the physical world, allowing me to achieve results that would be unattainable in a traditional laboratory. 

Since learning the Mystery of Dream Magic, I have begun to develop spells that incorporate its principles, yet this is only the beginning. One of my greatest ambitions is to overcome the barrier between dreams and reality. I wish to explore how the physical and dream realms might be interconnected, discovering ways to bring people and objects into dreams—or to manifest creations from dreams into the waking world. This concept drives much of my research, as I believe it holds great potential for Hermetic magic.

Although I know little of the Volshebnii Mechtateli, its existence and history intrigue me deeply. I would be eager to learn more about the group’s traditions, philosophy, and practices, as well as Raisa’s original insights. It is rare to find others who truly understand and appreciate the power and potential of dreams, and the chance to connect with such individuals would be an incredible privilege.

Should there be any opportunity to correspond further or to learn more about the mysteries of the Volshebnii Mechtateli, I would be most grateful. Please know that I approach this subject with great respect for the tradition you uphold and a sincere hope to contribute to the understanding of these extraordinary mysteries. 

Thank you for taking the time to write to me and for sharing your thoughts. I look forward to hearing from you and hope that this may be the beginning of a fruitful exchange. 

Yours in the Art, Penelope ex Merinita 
Winter 1226

Malachai vive no covenant de Roznov, na borda do Tribunal do Reno com a Transylvania. To get there, the best way is likely:
* 10 days to get to the Mercere House in Aix
* Mercere portal to Harco
* Mercere portal to Valnastium
* Mercere portal to Vienna
* Vienna to Roznov
	* 12-20 on foot
	* 8-14 on horseback

**Critical Factors Influencing Your Journey in 1231**

Beyond simple distance and speed, several historical realities of 1231 would have profoundly impacted your travel:

1. Political Conflict: The direct conflict you would have faced in 1231 was between Leopold VI and King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia. With Leopold's passing, one might assume hostilities ceased. However, he was succeeded by his son, **Frederick II**, a man known to history as _Friedrich der Streitbare_—**Frederick the Quarrelsome.**.
	* Border Crossings: While the declared war of 1231 may have formally ended, Frederick II's reign was characterized by near-constant, aggressive disputes with all his neighbors, including Bohemia. The political landscape was not one of stable peace, but of simmering hostility. A fragile peace had been brokered in 1232, but Frederick's ambition and erratic nature meant that a border skirmish, a raid, or a new diplomatic crisis could erupt with no warning..
	* Banditry and Raids: In times of war, lawlessness increases. The risk of encountering bandits or military raiding parties would have been high, forcing travelers to seek safety in numbers, which would slow the pace, or to take long, circuitous detours.
* **2. Terrain and Season:** The route from Vienna initially follows the relatively flat lands along the Morava river. However, the journey into what is now the Zlín Region involves navigating increasingly hilly and eventually mountainous terrain. 
	* **Summer:** The most favorable time to travel, with long daylight hours. 
	* **Spring and Autumn:** Heavy rains could turn roads into impassable mud, adding days to the journey.
	* **Winter:** Snowfall in the Moravian highlands and mountains could make the route entirely impassable for weeks at a time.

## Escorts

This escort is smaller, more expensive (£10), and assembled for a journey where subtlety and specific skills are deemed more important than brute force.

- **Leader & Scout: Corvus, "The Crow" (Redcap Agent):**
    - **Description:** A younger, leaner Redcap with sharp eyes and dark hair. Corvus is a specialist in scouting and infiltration. He is quiet and observant, preferring to avoid trouble rather than confront it. He is a master of moving unseen and navigating difficult wilderness.
    - **Role & Skills:** Corvus travels ahead of the main party, identifying potential ambushes, finding safe paths around trouble spots, and securing lodging in advance. He excels at **Stealth**, **Awareness**, **Survival**, and is a skilled **Bowman**. He can live off the land for days.
    - **Role for Penelope:** As a Merinita, Penelope might find a kindred spirit in Corvus, who is more attuned to the wilderness. He would be more understanding of her need to investigate natural curiosities, so long as it doesn't compromise the mission's security.
- 
- **Guardian & Fixer: Elena, the Ex-Circassian Slave (Bodyguard):**
    - **Description:** A woman of sharp intelligence and sharper knives, Elena was freed from a slaver's caravan by a Mercere agent years ago and now serves the House with fierce loyalty. She is worldly, speaks several languages, and understands the criminal underworld.
    - **Role & Skills:** She is Penelope's personal bodyguard, never far from her side. While a deadly fighter (**Single Weapon** with her paired daggers), her true strength lies in her social acumen. She possesses high **Guile**, **Intrigue**, and **Legerdemain**. If a bribe needs to be paid, a lock needs to be picked, or a rumor needs to be planted, Elena is the one to do it.
    - **Story Hook:** Elena despises the nobility, seeing them as little better than the slavers she escaped. Her open contempt for a local lord or knight at a delicate moment could create a serious diplomatic incident that Corvus's subtlety cannot prevent.

## The initiation

Malachai is stern, rigid, and ruthless in real life, but patient, wise and pensative in the Dream. He envision the [Volshebnii Mechtateli](Volshebnii%20Mechtateli.md) as enlightened magi, and expects a lot from his initiates. He himself was initiated 25 years ago, and while he can initiate [Penelope ex Merinita](Penelope%20ex%20Merinita.md) as a Lady of
The Passions, as she already knows Dream Magic, learning The Greater Dream Grimoire will require a ritual inside the dream, and finally be accepted as a Monarchs of the Veiled Court. He is adamant on her finishing her job, and abandoning the cult will require a permanent destruction of the secret knowledges with Perdo Mentem.

First, Penelope needs Volshebnii Mechtateli Lore 1. Then, he will initiate in Affinity (Imaginem). And finally, initiate in The Greater Dream Grimoire.

For the first step, Penelope need to make an Oath of never revealing the Mystery secrets no non-initiates, and to destroy any leaked knowledge. Also to dedicate her life to beautiful dreams and to serve the Order, following the motto: 'In Dreams Begin Responsibilities'.

He explains that Dream Magi needs strong anchors to reality, otherwise they will be dragged to live shadow lives inside the Dreamscape.

He then provides Penelope with a Tractus of Volshebnii Mechtateli Lore Q8. She will read while in Roznov. She is forbidden to climb the towers to the mountains. Next, she will start her script for Affinity (Imaginem).

Malachai have a Presence of 0, and Volshebnii Mechtateli Lore 5. So he needs a Script of at least +7 to initiate a Minor Virtue. 

Minor Ordeal: Gains Poor (Dexterity) or Poor (Strength). (-3 on the fist initiation after this, then -2 and -1).

Script: 
* +3 Minor Ordeal
* +3 Major Focus (Dreams)
* +3 Quest

### The Ordeal: The Cauldron of Morpheus

This ordeal is designed not as a test of strength or wit in the waking world, but as a journey of surrender within the landscape of the soul. Malachai, being of the _Volshebnii Mechtateli_ tradition, would not conduct this in a sterile Hermetic laboratory, but in a place thick with mystic resonance.

**The Setting:** Malachai leads Penelope not to his sanctum, but to a hidden grotto or a secluded chamber deep within his covenant at Roznov. The air is thick with the scent of burning herbs unfamiliar to Penelope—mugwort, silver birch bark, and something akin to cold stone. The only light comes from tallow candles whose flames cast long, dancing shadows. In the center of the room is a large, dark bronze cauldron filled with what appears to be pure, clear water, though it reflects the candlelight as if it were a solid, polished surface.

**The Process:**

1. **The Preparation:** For a full day and night, Penelope must fast, consuming only a specially prepared herbal infusion. This tea, brewed by Malachai, is designed to weaken the body's connection to the conscious mind and make the spirit more pliable. This physical deprivation is the first step, beginning the process that will culminate in her physical flaw.
2. **The Invocation:** At dusk on the second day, Malachai will have Penelope sit before the cauldron. He will not speak in Latin, but in his old tongue, a dialect of Old Church Slavonic. His chanting is a low, resonant drone that seems to pull the very shadows towards the cauldron. He is not casting a formulaic spell, but inviting the genius loci of the place and the spirits of the dream to bear witness and to open a gateway.
3. **The Immersion:** Malachai instructs Penelope to gaze into the water's surface and not to look away. As she stares, the reflection of the candles will fade, replaced by a swirling mist of colors. This is the gateway. He will then pose a single instruction: _"To learn the Grimoire, you must allow it to read you. Do not fight what you see. Do not struggle against the bindings. Embrace the lesson of the phantom limb. Only by accepting what is lost can you grasp what is offered."_
4. **The Dream Ordeal:** Penelope's consciousness is drawn into the cauldron, into a shared dreamscape curated by Malachai.
    - **Phase 1: The Phantom Self:** She finds herself in a world woven from her own memories and desires, a place of perfect illusion. Here, her physical form is potent, agile, and strong—an idealized version of herself. She is presented with a series of physical challenges that are effortless and exhilarating: leaping across rooftops, wrestling a great beast, or sculpting stone with her bare hands. This is a lure, a reminder of the body's power.
    - **Phase 2: The Binding:** A figure coalesces from the dreamstuff—a being of smoke and whispers, the embodiment of the Dream Grimoire itself. It offers her a choice, not in words, but in feelings. The glorious physical power she is experiencing is an illusion, a lie told by the dream. To gain true mastery over illusion (_Imaginem_), she must forsake this lie. As she accepts, ethereal, shimmering cords lash out from the dreamscape and bind her limbs.
    - **Phase 3: The Wasting:** Each time she tries to move her physical dream-body, the cords tighten. If she struggles, they drain her. The only way to proceed is to stop trying to use her body and instead use her will, her imagination. To move a stone, she must not lift it, but _will_ it to move. To cross a chasm, she must not jump, but create a bridge of pure thought. With every act of pure imagination, her dream-body grows weaker, more sluggish and clumsy. Her dream-Strength and dream-Dexterity are siphoned away to fuel her command of the dreamscape. This psychosomatic wasting is the core of the ordeal.
5. **The Awakening:** When the ordeal is complete—when she has fully embraced the power of thought over the power of the flesh—she will awaken by the side of the cauldron, gasping. She will feel a profound physical weakness, an ache in her bones and a clumsiness in her fingers, as if her body is no longer entirely her own. This is the manifestation of the **Poor (Strength or Dexterity) Flaw**. However, when she looks at the world, the play of light and shadow, the subtle tells of emotion on Malachai's face, the very texture of the air, will seem preternaturally clear and significant. This is the dawning of her **Affinity with Imaginem**.

### The Quest: The Echo in the Grotto

The ordeal is over, but the ritual has left a resonance, an echo in the place where the veil between worlds was thinned.

**The Premise:** A few weeks after the initiation, strange occurrences begin in and around Roznov. A woodsman complains of nightmares where the trees whisper his deepest sins. A serving girl is found in a trance, convinced she is a noble lady in a castle of glass. Most troubling for Malachai, he finds his own dreams are no longer private; he feels a subtle, prying presence at the edges of his slumber, attempting to glean his secrets.

Malachai explains to Penelope that the grotto where her ordeal took place now acts as a weak regio, a place where the dream world bleeds into the waking one. The power of her initiation has attracted something—a parasitic dream-spirit, an _oneiric scavenger_, that is now feeding on the stray thoughts and nightmares of those nearby and has become bold enough to probe a magus.

**The Quest:** Malachai tasks Penelope with solving this problem. He cannot enter the dream-regio himself, as the entity is using the echo of _his_ ritual as a key; his presence would only feed it and give it more power and purchase over him. Penelope, however, having been the focal point of the ritual, can enter the dreamscape and confront the entity on its own terms. Her new Affinity makes her uniquely suited for this task.

**The Challenge:** Penelope must enter a meditative trance in the grotto and consciously project her mind back into the dreamscape. This time, however, it is not a guided journey but a hunt.

1. **Navigating the Distorted Landscape:** The dreamscape is now twisted by the entity's presence. The woodsman's nightmares manifest as a forest of whispering, judgmental trees. The girl's fantasy is a dangerously fragile palace of glass that shatters into razor-sharp shards with a careless thought. Penelope must use her Imaginem arts not to create, but to perceive—to see through the illusions and find the creature's trail.
2. **The Confrontation:** She tracks the entity to its lair, a nexus of stolen dreams. The _oneiric scavenger_ appears as a shifting amalgam of fears and desires—a cloaked figure with the woodsman's accusing eyes, wearing a crown of shattered glass from the girl's fantasy. It cannot be fought with bolt or blade. The battle is one of will and imagination. It will attack her with phantasms of her own fears and doubts, manifestations of her new physical weakness.
3. **The Solution:** She cannot destroy it with force. She must use her newfound mastery of _Imaginem_ to outwit it. Perhaps she creates a powerful illusion of a greater predator, scaring it away. Or she could create a dream-lure so delectable—the "perfect nightmare" or "purest joy"—that the entity becomes trapped within it, like a fly in amber. The most elegant solution might be to use her understanding of the dream to sever its connection to the grotto, casting it adrift in the endless sea of slumber.

Completing this quest will not only solve a dangerous problem for her initiator but will serve as the first true test of her new powers, forcing her to rely on her magical Affinity rather than the physical prowess she has sacrificed. It will be a testament to the wisdom of the Greater Dream Grimoire.
