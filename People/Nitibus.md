Protection of the Close Friend, 0 points, Init +3, Protection of the Close Friend, 0 points, Init
+3, Mentem: The chosen victim of a shedeh cannot act directly against it without extreme provocation; it would be akin to attacking one’s own mother. The victim may be as angry as they like with the demon, but actually physically opposing it requires a huge effort of will, which must be repeated every time the victim wants to renew his attacks.

Vis: 2 pawns of Vim, in each of his two tongues

Appearance: His true appearance is as a pointy-nosed man with a face on both sides of his head. One face flatters his victim, the other criticizes others. He wears the same clothes as his victim, but does not look quite as good in them. When clothed in his Apparition Power, only one of his faces can be seen at a time, but his neck spins to interchange between the two. Nitibus attaches himself to those who have a natural inclination towards criticism. He then encourages this vice at every
opportunity, whispering into the ear of his victim to indicate any opportunities that he might have otherwise missed to put others down and belittle their efforts. Nitibus panders to the vanity of his chosen victim (who suffers from the Story Flaw Plagued by a Demon), always pointing out how much better he is than his peers.
