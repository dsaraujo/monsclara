Luc of Merinita is a 76-year-old magus and the unofficial leader of the covenant Ara Maxima Nova. He is a charismatic and outspoken man, fascinated by mysteries and obsessed with delving into them. He is considered a master of Imaginem, Mentem, and Vim magic. Luc is the mystagogue of a splinter cult of the Merinita faction of the Keepers of a Thousand Tales, which is incorporating aspects of the Cult of Heroes. He experiments with cult rites, blending different kinds of esoteric knowledge, faerie lore, and astrological signs to create new initiations.

Luc's covenant, Ara Maxima Nova, is located in Perpignan and focuses on the development of his cult. The covenant is known for its high-quality wine and cork production, which funds the magi's research into the Herculean legends and the Dionysian Mysteries. Luc's personal goals include locating the Hesperides to complete his reenactment of the Labors of Heracles, establishing a legacy for his cult, and finding a way to reverse the sterilizing effects of his Longevity Ritual.

He was invited to Mons Clara, where he went to study the _Aegis_, the shield of Perseus, that appeared on [Penelope ex Merinita](Penelope%20ex%20Merinita.md)'s Lab in the Winter of [1224](1224.md). While there, he is also helping Spatha ex Verditius to learn _Planetary Magic_:

Initiation Script: The Celestial Tapestry

Target Level: 15 (since Planetary Magic is a Minor Virtue and assuming Luc does not currently possess it1 . If Luc were to study Planetary Magic beforehand, the target level for Spatha would be 15 as Luc would know the Mystery Virtue he is Initiating1 .)

Mystagogue: Luc ex Merinita (Presence +2, assuming a moderate Presence based on his "Charismatic +2" personality trait2 ). For the purpose of this initiation, we will assume Luc develops a minor understanding of astrological lore relevant to Planetary Magic, granting him a Planetary Lore of 1 for the initiation. This acts as the (Mystery Cult) Lore for this specific initiation3 . Luc's Mystagogue Total before the Script Bonus is 2 (Presence) + 1 (Planetary Lore) = 3.

Script Bonus: +12

Script Details:

1. The Star-Seeker's Quest (+3): Spatha must undertake a quest to find a specific location with a strong astrological significance. This could be an ancient site believed to have been used for celestial observation (drawing inspiration from the mention of ancestor sites4 ...) or a natural formation that aligns with particular constellations during certain times of the year. Luc suggests [[Mont Ventoux]], but it is willing to find a new one.
2. The Night Vigil Ordeal (+3): Once the location is found, Spatha must spend a full lunar cycle performing nightly vigils at the site. During these vigils, he must meticulously observe the movements of Mars (aligned to Ignem and Weapons, Armor and War). He is forbidden from using any magical means of enhancing his sight or understanding during this time, relying solely on his natural senses and mundane astronomical knowledge. This serves as a Minor Ordeal, representing the dedication and focused observation required.
3. Luc's Celestial Guidance (+3): Over a season, Luc will instruct Spatha in the Hermetic understanding of astrology and the specific planetary influence Spatha has been observing Luc, drawing on his Merinita penchant for storytelling , might weave tales and allegories connecting the planet's movements and symbolic meanings to Hermetic principles and the Art of Ignem.
4. The Confluence Ritual (+2): On a night when the observed planet is in a significant astrological alignment (determined by Luc), Spatha and Luc will perform a ritual at the chosen site. This ritual will involve chanting Hermetic incantations focused on the Form appropriate to the planet (Ignem for Mars) and incorporating symbolic gestures that reflect the planet's influence. This special time and place contribute to the script bonus.
5. The Symbolic Offering (+1): As a final act of dedication and a symbolic sacrifice9 ..., Spatha must create a small, non-magical representation of the planet he observed (e.g., a carefully crafted metal orb or a drawing on parchment using specific natural pigments) and leave it at the chosen location as an offering to the celestial powers.

**Initiation Total Calculation**: Luc's Presence (+2) + Luc's Planetary Lore (+1) + Script Bonus (+12) = 15.

Since the Initiation Total (15) meets the Target Level (15), Spatha will successfully learn the Minor Hermetic Virtue Planetary Magic.
