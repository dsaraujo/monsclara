Elornis One-Leg spends at least a season a year in his North African homeland or traveling through dreams. Descended from a line of African diviners, his Heartbeast is that of a greater flamingo. Both magi are aware of the legendary horses of the Camargue led by the Great Stallion but contact is minimal (See Realms of Power: Magic, pages 59–60).
