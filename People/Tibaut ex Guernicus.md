## Tibaut's Investigation

`Tibaut ex Guernicus` is collecting info from the Tribunal since his return in 1198. After receiving the new magi in Mons Clara, and refreshing the covenfolk to support the covenant (plus a new talisman to counteract his scrying twilight scar), he decided to go and start his investigation of the apparent series of attacks to Chief Quaesitors.

When he received Beatrice in 12XX, she talked about how she has discovered some evidence on the misterious disappearance of Protantus ex Guernicus and Senex ex Guernicus.

- 1163 - Elected Quaesitor
- 1193 - Elected Chief Quaesitor
- 1200 - Gauntlet of Beatrice ex Guernicus. She moves to Castra Solis.
- 1206 - Twilight
- 1207 - Protantus ex Guernicus, a Mercurian traditionalist, takes place as Chief Quaesitor. A bit after, he is murdered in a plot to get someone more friendly to the Church to navigate the Albegiense Crusade. The plot was devised by Garus, and it was a botch job. The idea was to capture and exile the magus after he would be condemmend as an infernalist. While nobody knows the details of the coup, rumors of foul play still resists. Beatrice discovers part of plot, and have a fall with Garus. It will keep Beatrice away from Castra Solis for more than two decades. Senex ex Merinita then took place on the same year.
- 1210 - Senex starts his investigation on an Infernal cult presence in Provançal.
- 1213 - Senex investigation leads him to a faerie regio in the west region near Mimizan, Médoc, in the realm of the capricious queen Oriande Le Fee. Almost losing his life, he discovers the dark secret of Dama and Maju. Unfortunately he is betrayed by Oriande, and is killed by Maju, without Dama's knowledge.
- 1214 - Provençal Tribunal - Beatrice of Guernicus is elected Chief Quaesitor.
- 1218 - Tibaut return from Twilight
- 1221 - Beatrice visits Mons Clara, and shares the disappearance of Senex, and that he was investigating infernalism and faerie regios. She shares the story of Protantus, but asks Tibaut to not expose Garus: this would fracture the Flambeau and caused a bit hit to the order, especially with the Crusades happening.
- 1222 - Tibaut makes a magical wand versus Fae and Infernal Creatures
- 1223 - Tibaut vai com Drusilla para Mimizan para conversar com Dama.
- 1230, Spring - Tibaut confronta [Dama ex Merinita](Dama%20ex%20Merinita.md) em seu caminho para [Aedes Mercurii](Aedes%20Mercurii.md), onde procurava Ophilio ex Mercere para um novo ritual de longevidade. 

# Dama's Ambush

The attack occurred within an abandoned house; feigning an emergency, she lured him inside where Maju waited in a viper form. The Praeco shattered Tibaut’s Parma Magica with Revoke the Protection of Bonisagus, but Maju’s poison failed to quickly incapacitate the Quaesitor. He burst from the house and into the road before collapsing. The pair attempted to retrieve him, but fate intervened. A large group of Crusader knights witnessed the man’s collapse and rode to aid him.

Divinely Blessed and resistant to Dama’s magics, they carried the dying Tibaut to the nearby Abbey of Saint Hilaire, thinking him to be a monk. The monks said that Tibaut was not one of theirs, but took him in anyway. In their care, he succumbed to the poison. As they thought about events afterwards, the Crusaders formed the belief that Tibaut had been a Cathar, and returned to raid the abbey in retribution for the monks’ activities. The monks of St. Hilaire have occasional contact with some of the Tribunal’s Redcaps, trading various goods in exchange for bookmaking
materials or blank quires. Through this route, the news of the death eventually traveled back to Castra Solis, which attempted to make arrangements to recover the man’s effects. They met with no success as his body already lay buried in the Abbey’s cemetery and the monks remained in a state of disarray after the Crusaders’ attack. Tibaut’s belongings sit locked in a chest in the abbot’s office, as the Albigensian Crusade remains particularly active in the region

## The Faerie Regio

Após o inverno, explica suas preocupações para Dama. Maju escuta tudo, e prepara uma emboscada para o Guernicus. Um grupo grande de fadas (soldados similares a elfos com armaduras de folhas) captura o magus, e o leva para dentro de um régio feérico, onde ele fica preso por vários meses. Numa noite, apesar dele se isolar num circulo com ward feerico de nível 30 com +34 de penetration, Maju em sua forma de lebre atravessa o círculo, mas triga um ward de alarme.

Ele se transforma em um grifo, atacando o mago para ferí-lo mortalmente, que tenta castar leap of homecoming através da entrada criada por Maju. Ela dá muita sorte, e recebe um heavy wound da bicada (que Maju ainda infuses with Snake Poison de easy factor of 9), e consegue, por pouco, castar a magia.

Ele trouxe uma pena do animal.

Learned Fairy Lore from Sybil in 1225.

---

Your players seek the sanctum of a magus who was not merely a scholar, but the ex-leader of Mons Clara 11, a Quaesitor2, and a man consumed by a terrible investigation. His disappearance was not a quiet fading but a violent capture by the Faerie Queen Oriande Lafay 3333333, which culminated in his Final Twilight4444.

Therefore, his sanctum should not be a dusty, forgotten room. It is a scene frozen at the moment of crisis, a testament to the obsessions that consumed him. Here are my thoughts on what your players might find within.

Many wards in the lab / true sanctum
Lab with conspiracy / Griffin studies.

### 1. The Paranoid Investigator's Workshop

Tibaut was a Quaesitor investigating a suspected infernal cult 5555555and, at the same time, held deep suspicions about the Merinita Praeco, "A Dama"666666. His sanctum would reflect this:

- **A "Conspiracy" Map:** Not a simple map of Provence7, but one annotated by his own hand. Scrawled notes and strings of red thread might link the location of Mons Clara, the Faerie regio he visited 8, the Merinita covenant of Mimizan (home of A Dama) 9999, and locations of suspected infernal activity10101010101010.
    
- **A Hidden _Armarius_:** A secret, warded closet or book-press11. This would not hold his standard library, but his private Quaesitorial ledgers. Inside, they might find his detailed, paranoid notes on "A Dama," whom he suspected was "overcome by an external force" 121212, and his research into the infernal cult1313.
    
- **Wards Against Magi:** The sanctum itself would be heavily defended14. Perhaps the sanctum marker 15is a complex riddle, similar to the cryptic scroll case he sent the players16. The wards might be designed not just to keep out the curious, but specifically to alert him to the presence of other magi, especially those of House Merinita, whom his daughter Beatriz also distrusts171717171717171717.
    

### 2. The Fae-Haunted Laboratory

His downfall was the Fae18181818. His laboratory would be a strange mix of anti-fae defenses and fae research subjects, showing his obsession.

- **The Griffin Feather:** This is the prize the players seek19191919. It should be here, but not in the open. Perhaps it is laid out on a table under a heavy enchantment, surrounded by lenses and ritual knives, as if he were in the middle of dissecting it when he left. The session notes are clear: this feather is _not_ truly Fae202020202020202020. This is the central clue. When the players examine it, they may find it radiates a different aura—perhaps Magic, or more sinisterly, Infernal, linking his two great investigations21212121.
    
- **Materials of War:** Cold iron bars 22 stored near his forge. Half-finished charms and wards against Faeries23. Books on Faerie Lore 24and perhaps on the ancient Welsh goddess Cirona (Oriande's true name)25252525.
    
- **A Link to the Infernal:** His notes on the feather might sit next to his notes on the infernal cult26262626. Perhaps he had just discovered a link between the two. The "fae" entity that sent him into Twilight 27272727 may have been the very demon he was hunting, disguised.
    

### 3. The Living Ghost: Micaela

A sanctum is not just a place; it is defined by its inhabitants. Tibaut's sanctum is not empty.

- **The Warped Assistant:** His 91-year-old lab assistant, Micaela, still resides there28282828. She is loyal, aged, and suffering from four points of Warping29292929. She would be the sanctum's guardian.
    
- **Her State:** Her Warping could be a potent story hook. Is she physically twisted, blending into the strange magical energies of the lab? Is she mentally warped, her memory shattered, mistaking one of the players for Tibaut returned? She might devotedly protect his "most important work" (the Griffin Feather) 303030while muttering his last words to her: "Beware the Dama... the Serpent... it's not Fae..."313131313131313131. She is a tragic figure, a source of fragmented clues and a moral quandary for the players.
    

### 4. The Unfinished Work

He left suddenly and never returned. The lab should feel like a man interrupted in the middle of a great discovery.

- **A Bubbling Still:** An alchemical experiment, perhaps for a longevity potion for Micaela 32323232 or himself, still bubbles magically, long since spoiled into a strange, magical slurry.
    
- **An Open Book:** On his desk, a book lies open. Given his state of mind, it might be a _Summa_ on _Parma Magica_ (as he was debating its limits 33333333) or, more intriguingly, a _Tractatus_ on Criamon Enigmatic Wisdom 34or Mentem, as he was seeking a Criamon to teach him to "navigate the mysteries of the mind"35. This shows his desperate search for mental defenses.
    
- **The Failed Laboratory Feature:** Perhaps he was building a specialized laboratory feature 36to aid his investigation—a scrying pool (InAq) 37to watch his enemies, or a summoning circle 38 to interrogate spirits. It is unfinished, its components laid out but the magic incomplete.

### Major Hubs (Places)

- **Mons Clara**: The center of the web. This is his home, his sanctum, but also the place he feels is most besieged.

    - _Annotation: "The heart of the rot. She brought _it_ back with her. Is she a puppet or a willing conspirator? Does it matter?"_
        
- **Aedes Mercurii**: The covenant of the longevity specialist Ophilio. A red thread would mark a route from Mimizan to here.
    
    - Annotation: "Her longevity ritual is spent. She _must_ go to him. My chance to intercept her. Spring 1230."

- **Nascente do Verdon** : A vis source contended by Mons Clara and the "Magos do Cenóbio".
    
    - Annotation: "Who are these 'Magos do Cenóbio'? Are they the 'mystery house' cult? Too convenient."
        
- **The Faerie Regio (near Médoc)**: The regio he intended to investigate, near Mimizan.
    
    - Annotation: "She returned from _a_ regio. Was it this one? What did she bring back?"

Texto: Watching Ward

### 1. The Legalistic Snare (The Door)

A Quaesitor's mind is a fortress of rules. His sanctum's entrance would be a test of _intent_ and _identity_.

- **The Decoy Marker:** The obvious sanctum marker—perhaps a rune-carved stone set in the door—is a fake. Touching it, as one does to request entry, triggers a powerful, non-damaging effect: a _Loud Ward_ (CrIm) that sounds an alarm across the covenant, _and_ a simple _Curse of the Incompetent Hand_ (PeCo) that gives a -3 penalty to all manual dexterity rolls for an hour (making research or disabling other traps difficult).
    
- **The True Marker:** The _true_ sanctum marker, which must be touched to pass without triggering the _Aegis_, is something inconspicuous. It might be a single, scorched brick on the floor _inside_ the threshold, or the iron ring of a specific (and seemingly unimportant) book on his shelf. The clue to this might be hidden in the cryptic scroll case he already sent the players.
    
- **The Quaesitor's Gaze (ReMe):** A low-level, permanent effect at the threshold. Anyone crossing it who has _malicious intent_ towards Tibaut or _knowledge of the Infernal_ feels a sudden, sharp psychic probe. This probe does no damage, but it _activates_ another trap...
    

### 2. The Scribe of Suspicions (The Lab)

This trap is not for defense, but for _evidence_. Upon entering, the players trigger the true heart of his paranoia, linked to his conspiracy map.

- **The Accusing Quill:** When "The Quaesitor's Gaze" is triggered (or simply when any magus enters), a black quill pen, resting in an inkwell on his desk, magically levitates and begins to write in a large, open ledger.
    - It will write the _name_ of the intruder.
    - Beside the name, it will write their _House_.
    - **The Trap:** If a magus of **House Merinita** enters (like Penelope), the quill will scribe their name, and the ink will instantly _boil and turn a sickly red_. This is a clear, terrifying sign of his specific paranoia. It is an _InCo/InMe_ effect that he spent years perfecting, a "lie detector" for his most hated foes.
        

### 3. Wards Against the Foe (Targeted Defenses)

His sanctum would be weaponized against the _specific_ enemies he was hunting: The Fae (Oriande) and the Serpent (A Dama's familiar).

- **Lines of Cold Iron:** Not just a circle, but _hidden lines_ of powdered cold iron inlaid into the floor grooves around his desk and the pedestal holding the Griffin Feather. Any fae-blooded character (or a Merinita with strong fae ties) who crosses them feels a burning pain, as if walking on coals. A true Fae creature would be barred entry.
    
- **The Serpent's Bane (ReAn):** Given his deep suspicion of A Dama's serpent familiar, "Maju," the _entire sanctum_ is protected by a powerful, permanent _Ward Against Snakes_. No serpent, mundane or magical, may enter this room. This may seem irrelevant until players realize it would have also barred A Dama's familiar, proving he was actively working against her.
    
- **The Mirror of Truth (PeIm):** A small, silver hand-mirror on his desk. It seems mundane, but it is a defense against glamours. It is enchanted to _dispel_ Faerie illusions. If a player is disguised by Faerie magic (or even a _Muto_ spell), picking up the mirror will instantly shatter their illusion.
    

### 4. The Unstable Experiment (The Hazard)

Tibaut was taken in a moment of crisis. His final work would be unfinished and dangerous.

- **The Unfinished Aegis:** On a workbench sits a complex (and beautiful) array of silver wiring, vis crystals, and griffin feathers (from _other_ griffins, not the one he was studying). This is a half-finished magic item.
    
    - **The Trap:** It is unstable. Any _magical_ energy that comes near it—a player casting a spell, a magical creature entering, or even a failed _Intellego_ roll—will cause it to overload. It will discharge a flash of raw, uncontrolled magic (a "Magical Surge"), forcing a Warping roll on everyone nearby. It is not a trap; it is a _hazard_, a testament to his desperate, interrupted work.
        

### 5. The Guardian's Lament (The Living Trap)

His assistant, **Micaela**, is the most dangerous element. Her Warping and loyalty create a tragic and unpredictable defense.

- **Warped Perceptions:** She is hidden in the shadows of the lab when the players enter. Her Warping has fractured her mind. She may mistake one of the magi for Tibaut, another for "A Dama," and another for an Inquisitor.
    
- **The Shriek:** Her "attack" is not physical. If she panics, she will let out a piercing shriek. This is a sound she has been trained to make. The shriek is the _trigger_ for another ward: a linked _Shatter the Ear_ (PeIm) spell that aims to deafen all intruders, causing panic and pain, allowing her to flee or protect the master's work.
    
- **The Final Sacrifice:** If she sees a player she believes to be "A Dama" or an infernal agent reach for the Griffin Feather, she will act. She will not attack them; she will try to _destroy the feather itself_, perhaps by sweeping it into the Unstable Aegis, believing she is saving her master's soul from his "tainted" work.
