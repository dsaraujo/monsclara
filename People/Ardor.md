This is the usual melee attack of a phlegethus. Any flammable material catches fire on contact; typically, clothes inflict +10 damage per round on their wearer until they are extinguished. Any metal coming into contact with the elemental’s body for more than a round heats up, causing the effects of Heat of the Searing Forge, but this does not include weapons that attempt to strike it in combat.
