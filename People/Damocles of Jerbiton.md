Damocles follows the Jerbiton philosophy of sufficiency. He believes he has learned enough magic to allow him to do as he likes for the rest of his life. Further study would allow him to fool larger crowds, and perform better in certamen, but this fails to recompense him for his effort. Further study simply isn’t worth the time.

For a long while, Mathieus knew that increasing his ability to perform magic was not fulfilling, but did not know what he wished to do instead. He spent those years indulging in many of the vices of the rich.

He now has a series of goals, although he does not believe he will fulfill any of them.

They include:

• Support of the French Crown, because its strength is redesigning Paris into a city with the potential to sponsor great acts of beauty. This may cause conflict with the agents of significant French dukes, agents of the English Crown, and the minions of Italian princes.

• Support for the rising generation of Jerbiton magi, called Antigones. Mathieus supports the Order as the best tool for peace currently available, but simultaneously believes it is a poor and weak tool, which he hopes the Antigones will repair. He hosts part of the Intinerarium with Pola, which provides leading Antigones with an opportunity to meet almost every aspiring Jerbiton magus, and evangelize antigonic philosophy. This may provoke concern from more traditional magi when the Antigones begin to make political demands of the Order.

• Revulsion for Venice, and for those covenants he blames for the success of the Fourth Crusade. This includes support of the French Church, which Mathieus sees as a counterbalance to Venetian influence on the pope. He also dislikes and distrusts the many covenants in the Roman Tribunal that have chapter houses in Venice.

Damocles é breve, mas gentil. Ele demonstra uma particular frustração contra Veneza e os magos de lá (Jebitons mas também Verditius) que apoiaram a quarta cruzada. Em relação a Rogier, ele lembra que ele leu sobre o covenant de Barbegal, um complexo com moinho dágua dominado por magos-ferreiros, todos Verditius, um pouco ao norte de Arles, que fora abandonado no começo do décimo século devido à ataques Sarracenos, e os magos sobreviventes ajudaram a fundar o Ceonobium. Rogier era um dos raros Verditius do tribunal e era muito curioso sobre Barbegal, acreditando que o local continha mistérios perdidos da casa Verditius. No entanto, ele deixou o covenant quando Tibaut ex Guernicus publicou notas com instruções específicas para chegar no local num tratado sobre Fraexinetum e os ataques Sarracenos buscando o local. Isso aconteceu em 1204, dezesseis anos atrás. Rogier é considerado como um magi que abandonou o tribunal e nunca mais deu notícia.
