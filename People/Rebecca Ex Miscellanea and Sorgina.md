Appearance: A mature and attractive Basque woman who wears a number of animal fetishes and generally keeps her hair pulled back and under a shawl. Rebecca dresses as a traditional Basque wise woman, in a dark woolen dress with a wide, bright scarf tied around her waist.

Voting Sigil: Rebecca has a wolf fetish which she uses as her voting sigil. Claimed in combat, it once belonged to a rival sorgina.

Design Notes: Rebecca was designed using the Folk Witch rules presented in Hedge Magic as a member of Ex Miscellanea Sorgina.

Raised in a Basque village, Rebecca’s father discovered a cache of Roman gold and kept it hidden. He used the wealth to provide Rebecca with a comfortable youth and an education. He’d hoped for
her to marry one of the minor knights who lived in the region and groomed her for just such a pairing. Unfortunately, Dama’s coven discovered her and encouraged several of the area’s potential
suitors to depart on Crusade. The young girl then joined the coven, becoming the primary aide to Dama at Mimizan after her apprenticeship. 

Rebecca regularly acts as an emissary, messenger, or spy for Dama, utilizing her flight and shapeshifting powers to move quickly and remain hidden. She often travels back to her home village, where she spends time assisting the local whalers by secretly flying overhead.
The hunters believe the appearance of her albatross form to be a good omen and cheerfully sail where she indicates. Rebecca also helps young mothers recover from childbirth through potions, but she demands the afterbirth as payment. The folk witch harvests 5 pawns of Corpus vis, her personal vis source, by rendering this material at an ancient hillside shrine on the Spring Equinox. Bordering on pagan, Rebecca has no qualms regarding the *Maters and Matrones* cult, feeling it is
good and just to provide such empowerment to women; after all, doesn’t mortal life spring from women?
