Wife of a dead crusader. Lost her faith in the Crurch (not God), worked as mercenary. Really dislikes noble knights now. Her grandfather was a fairy elf, but she doesn't like the heritage. Looking for a chance of starting over. Likes to teach, and will appreciate the Weldesians teachings.

Will prefer to bring her band (6 people, 4 men and 2 women) over the existing grogs.

Died running from Castellane, with an arrow on her back.
