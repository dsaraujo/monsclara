Marie of Merinita, also known as Marie of France, is a 113-year-old (@1220) Merinita maga residing in Poitiers. She lives in a manor house that is officially considered part of Castra Solis, even though it is located within the Normandy Tribunal. Marie attends Tribunal meetings in Provence and actively works to expand the Provencal Tribunal's borders by spreading the culture and language of southern France throughout Aquitaine.

Marie was trained by Dama, the current Praeco, and is a headstrong and independent maga. She idolized Eleanor of Aquitaine and claims to have accompanied her on the Second Crusade and back to Aquitaine after the annulment of her marriage. Marie believes she traveled to England with Eleanor and entertained the nobles there with her romances and fables. However, these events may not have actually happened; she may have followed a faerie queen in Arcadia who resembled Eleanor.

Marie is a skilled Parma Magica specialist and has achieved the second level of initiation in the Matres and Matrones cult. She has trained several apprentices who have gone on to other parts of Mythic Europe. Although Dama wants her to become a matron, Marie remains focused on her goal of expanding the Provencal Tribunal.
