Archmage Valgravian is the oldest magus of the covenant, an immigrant from the Rhine Tribunal. He created the contingency plan which saved the covenant, and his leadership guided Bellaquin through the transition. He maintains indirect contact with a few of his old noble friends, but he is far more cautious about his involvement in their affairs. He limits himself to advice and Longevity Rituals for the two or three closest to him. For the most part, he remains dedicated to the smooth management of the covenant. Other Bellaquin magi sometimes find him annoying, since he regularly talks to them about their covenant tasks. However, he gives members wide discretion in their offices and responsibilities. He rather seeks to exchange advice and knowledge about project execution, playing a fraternal role with the older members and a paternal role with the younger ones.

Valgravian is old friends with Constantine, and has known Antoinette since she was born. Beyond those relationships, he doesn’t know the other member magi very well, and sometimes he feels like a stranger in his own home. He remembers a time when Bellaquin was a covenant of poets and musicians, and laments the lack of troubadours in the area. New members mean new interests and ideas, and although Bellaquin remains a patron of the arts, it is so to a much lesser degree than previously.

The archmage concentrated his magical endeavors in the musical arts, having a Minor Magic Focus in music. He created various spells to create or enhance music, and fashioned an enchanted necklace which “captures” and memorizes the musical performance of the person wearing it, reproducing it later. His archmage contest demands a musical performance which moves him to tears.

His sigil is a faint fanfare of horns.
