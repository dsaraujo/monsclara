Ponte de Castellane

A "Troll of Might 30" is a powerful magical being, typically resembling an ugly or misshapen giant. The term "troll" can generically refer to a Magic or Faerie humanoid with supernatural powers. Trolls often have a Size between +2 and +4. Such a creature at Might 30 would pose significant challenges, capable of problematic encounters for even a middle-aged magus.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of what the stats for a Troll of Magic Might 30 might look like, drawing on information about similar creatures like giants and magical monsters:

**Troll (Magic Human / Magical Monster)**

- **Magic Might**: **30** (Corpus)
- **Size**: **+3** (This is a common size for trolls and smaller giants).
- **Characteristics**: Int –1, Per +1, Pre +1, Com –1, Str +7, Sta +4, Dex +0, Qik –1 [Derived]. These characteristics are consistent with a large, strong, and tough creature, accounting for the inherent physical adjustments from its Gigantic nature (Strength +6, Quickness –2 from a Size 0 base due to Gigantic quality, plus additional points from "Improved Characteristics" quality).
- **Confidence Score**: 1 (3) [Standard for many powerful creatures].

**Virtues and Flaws**:

- **Magic Human**: (Social Status Virtue), indicating a magical being with humanoid characteristics.
- **Magical Monster**: (Major Virtue), often used for powerful magical creatures.
- **Tough**: (Minor Virtue), increasing the creature's resilience.
- **Berserk**: (Major Virtue), allowing the troll to enter a powerful combat rage.
- **Reserves of Strength**: (Major Virtue), granting additional endurance or resilience.
- **Piercing Gaze**: (Minor Virtue), giving the troll an unnerving or impactful stare.
- **Monstrous Appearance**: (Major Flaw), a common trait for trolls, causing a –6 penalty to all social situations and often inciting fear or aggression from others.
- **Greedy**: (Minor Flaw), a personality trait frequently associated with ogres and trolls.
- **Wrathful**: (Minor Flaw), indicative of a short temper or violent nature.
- **Lesser Malediction (Sunlight is painful)**: (Minor Flaw), a common weakness for ettins or trolls, causing 2 Fatigue levels that do not recover until nightfall when exposed to direct sunlight.

**Magic Qualities and Inferiorities**: A Might 30 magical creature typically has 30 points to spend on Qualities.

- **Gigantic (x1)**: 3 points, which physically manifests the troll's Size +3.
- **No Fatigue**: 3 points (Major Quality), meaning the troll does not suffer fatigue penalties.
- **Improved Soak (x4)**: 4 points, significantly increasing its natural protection by +8.
- **Improved Attack (x3)**: 3 points, adding a +6 bonus to its attack rolls.
- **Improved Damage (x2)**: 2 points, adding a +4 bonus to its damage rolls.
- **Tough Hide**: 1 point, providing an additional +2 to its Soak score.
- **Improved Characteristics (x3)**: 3 points, allowing for additional enhancement of its raw stats, such as Strength, Stamina, and Dexterity.
- **Improved Abilities (x2)**: 2 points, granting 200 additional experience points for abilities.
- **Lesser Power (Keen Sense of Smell)**: 1 point, enhancing its sense of smell for tracking and awareness (e.g., +3 to smell rolls, +2 to Hunt rolls).
- **Greater Power (Terrifying Roar)**: 3 points. This power allows the troll to unleash a roar causing fear in all who hear it, requiring a Brave roll against Ease Factor 9 to overcome. (ReAn(Me) 30, Init +2).
- **Greater Power (Stone Projectile)**: 3 points. (This would be a custom power for a magical troll, enabling it to hurl large, powerful stones).

**Personality Traits**:

- **Wrathful +4**
- **Greedy +3**
- **Proud +3**
- **Stubborn +3**

**Reputations**:

- **Murderous 4 (local)** or **Terrible Monster 4 (Local Area)**
- Given the Monstrous Appearance and potential for violence, a general **Infamous 4** reputation is also appropriate.

**Combat**:

- **Great Cudgel**: Init –1, Attack +15, Defense +6, Damage +20. This weapon benefits from the troll's high Strength and Improved Attack/Damage qualities, making it a devastating strike similar to other powerful giants.
- **Claws**: Init –1, Attack +11, Defense +6, Damage +12. These natural weapons are common for monstrous humanoids.
- **Bite (Teeth)**: Init –1, Attack +11, Defense +6, Damage +13. Another natural weapon, reflecting its monstrous nature.
- **Thrown Stone**: Init –2, Attack +11, Defense +4, Damage +12 (This would use the Thrown Weapon ability and the troll's high Strength and damage bonuses).

**Soak**: **+18** (Calculated from Sta +5, Tough +3, Improved Soak +8, and Tough Hide +2) [Derived from qualities]. This makes the troll exceptionally resilient to physical harm. **Fatigue Levels**: OK, OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious. (The "No Fatigue" quality grants two initial penalty-free fatigue levels). **Wound Penalties**: –1 (1–8), –3 (9–16), –5 (17–24), Incapacitated (25–32), Dead (33+). These ranges are based on a creature of Size +3.

**Abilities**:

- **Great Weapon 5** (cudgel)
- **Thrown Weapon 5** (stones)
- **Survival 3** (wilderness)

- **Athletics 3** (running)
- **Awareness 3** (alertness)
- **Stealth** 3 (turning to stone)

### Plot Path II: The Sculptor Under the Bridge

**The Hook:** The last encounter with the troll at the Castellane bridge was a desperate battle for survival, ending with the creature's destruction. However, the magi know this is a temporary solution; the troll will eventually be reborn. Spatha and Theros previously explored the regio and saw statues of trolls being created. Apolo now holds a potent arcane connection: a finger from the defeated troll. It is time for a proactive strike to end the threat at its source.

**The Mystery Unveiled:**

- **Scene 1: Re-entering the Grotto:** The group travels to the bridge. The shimmering portal they glimpsed before is no longer visible. They must use magic to find it again. A powerful
    
    _Intellego Vim_ spell, perhaps boosted by Apolo's arcane connection, can reveal the entrance beneath the bridge. This time, the regio feels different—quieter, expectant.
    
- **Scene 2: The Artist's Workshop:** Inside, they find the strange workshop again. There are more troll statues in various states of completion. Most ominously, in the center of the cavern, is a new, child-sized troll statue, still rough but with a faint magical aura. It is slowly absorbing the ambient magic of the regio, growing. This is the new troll, in its infancy. They can destroy it now, but the sculptor will surely notice.
    
- **Scene 3: The Sculptor Revealed:** The sculptor is not a giant or a monster. From the shadows emerges a small, gnarled being made of living stone, its eyes like chips of flint. This is **Petrus**, a faerie artisan of the earth. He is not malicious. He is an _artist_, and the trolls are his masterpieces, embodiments of raw, destructive rage which he finds beautiful. He is annoyed, not angry, that they destroyed his finest work (the giant troll). He may ask them, with genuine curiosity, "Why would you shatter such a perfect expression of power?"
    
- **Scene 4: A Bargain of Creation or a Battle of Wills:** This encounter is not necessarily a combat one.
    
    - **The Bargain:** Petrus is driven to create. The magi can offer him a new medium. Spatha, a Verditius, could offer to supply him with rare metals from the covenant's mine, challenging him to sculpt something of permanence and beauty instead of ephemeral rage. Penelope could offer him dream-stuff, a canvas of pure imagination to shape nightmares and wonders. This could forge a strange and powerful, if amoral, alliance.
        
    - **The Battle:** If diplomacy fails, Petrus will defend his "nursery." He will not fight directly but will animate the other stone statues in his workshop. The challenge is fighting creatures of solid stone (+Te) in their own element. Petrus's goal is to subdue and eject the magi, not kill them. He just wants to be left alone with his art.
        
- **Resolution:** They either strike a deal with Petrus, convincing him to cease his troll-making in their domain, or they defeat him and destroy his workshop, ending the threat permanently. They could gain a powerful (if unsettling) faerie contact or secure their border definitively.
