# **The Charter of the Covenant of** Mons Clara

## The Council

  

The Covenant is governed by its Council, which initially is made up of all magi who found the Covenant. From that point forward, additional individuals may be elevated to the Council by vote. The vote does not need to be unanimous; one opposing vote is not enough to prevent elevation to the Council, but two opposing votes are. Those who sit on the Council have the title of Councillor.

  

An individual elevated to the Council must both swear the oath of this covenant and sign this charter in the presence of the Council. An individual who quits the Covenant, is expelled, enters Final Twilight, or dies is no longer a member of the Council.

  

A Councillor may voluntarily resign from the Council by submitting a formal, written notice of resignation to Council. The resignation shall take effect upon receipt of the notice, or at a specified later date as indicated in the notice, not to exceed one season.

  

A Councillor may be expelled from the Council for gross misconduct, a breach of the Covenant's oath or charter, or actions detrimental to the Covenant's well-being. Expulsion requires the same majority as membership: one opposing vote is not enough to prevent expulsion, but two opposing votes are \- the Councillor under consideration does not count as quorum for this voting. If possible, the Councillor in question shall be given the opportunity to present a defense before the vote is taken. Expelled individuals must leave the covenant by the next sunrise or sunset; they may ask to rejoin the Covenant after at least one year.

  

In addition to quitting, expulsion, entering Final Twilight, or death, a Councillor's membership on the Council shall also cease if they: are absent from Council meetings for 10 years without providing valid reason or notice or cease to be a member of the Order of Hermes.

  

## Conventus

  

The Council shall meet once per season and additionally as its members require. Any Councillor can call a meeting of the Council at any time, but meetings should be scheduled, when possible, to accommodate Councillors other requirements. All Councillors should make a good faith effort to attend all meetings. A Councillor who calls a meeting can insist on the inclusion of one item on the agenda. Meetings shall not be called so often or last so long as to impede laboratory work.

  

The Council must have a quorum for its meeting to be valid. A quorum is defined as **two-thirds of the Council's participating members, with a minimum of three**. Councillors who are in Twilight, away from the Covenant, unreachable in their Sanctum, or missing \-- all for  more than one season \-- are not considered to be participating. If these conditions apply for less than one season, the Councillor is still considered to be participating.

  

Any Councillor can propose any motion which is not contradicted by this charter, he is entitled to speak in Council, and has a single vote. Motions must be made and seconded before a vote is held. No more than one motion can be before the Council at a time; it must be voted upon, withdrawn, or dismissed for lack of a second, before another can be made. Debate can be conducted at any time during this process,

  

During debates, each Councillor shall have the opportunity to present their arguments for an equal amount of time. Once initial arguments are presented, each Councillor shall then have the opportunity to present a counter-argument or a response, for the same amount of time. Debates are then concluded, and the proposed motion will be voted upon.

  

Business before the Council shall be given a full and reasonable hearing before votes are conducted. Once a motion has earned a vote, the Council is not obligated to entertain further motions on the topic, or debate it, in the current meeting.

  

## Compensation for Service

  

Councillors are compensated for seasons spent serving the Covenant beyond what is required in the form of a Portion, which is an allotment of vis. The size of a Portion is determined on an annual basis, in the Spring, by a majority vote of the Council Portions are given out at the end of the season in which the service was performed. The specific flavor of the vis should be chosen by the Councillor who performed the service, and vis tenta is valued at twice vis forma. The Council can veto these flavor preferences as he thinks necessary, but he cannot prevent a Portion being paid unless paying such a Portion jeopardizes the Covenant's Aegis of the Hearth. The individual who has claimed the vis may need to venture out of the Covenant to collect it from the vis source.

  

Vis left over after the payment of Portions can be divided amongst the Council, paid to compensate for donations to the covenant, stockpiled, or otherwise used as the Council sees fit.

  

## Mundane Offices

  

The Covenant shall be served by a Seneschal, who is responsible for the daily management of the Covenant and reports to the Council, and also by a Turb Captain, who oversees the Turb of fighting Grogs. The Council can appoint new mundane offices as required \-- such as a Librarian, Master Scribe, or Huntsman \-- with a majority vote. Mundane officers are entitled to increased financial compensation commensurate with their responsibilities and skill, to private quarters within the covenant, and to other luxuries as the Council sees fit.

  

## Resources

  

The Covenant claims for itself and insists on the right to defend: all books listed in its official collection, all vis sources logged with House Mercere, all vis stocks and silver kept in its treasury, all enchanted items and valuable goods not belonging personally to a resident of the Covenant, all buildings and chattel within the Aegis of the Hearth, all cattle which sleep within the Aegis, and all Grogs and covenfolk who earn compensation from the covenant.

  

Individuals can donate books, enchanted items, vis, or other resources to the Covenant. In exchange for this donation, the individual shall be compensated with vis equal to its fair value on the Hermetic market, as determined by the Offices. If there is not sufficient vis for compensation to be made immediately, as judged by the Council, the donor may take the vis on account. This vis must be paid before the size of the annual Portions is decided, in the Spring meeting of the Council. An individual is never expected or compelled to donate resources to the Covenant, but should instead be rewarded for doing so. Once donated, the resource belongs to the Covenant and its use is governed like all other resources.

  

If Councillors, Grogs, covenfolk, or other Covenant residents come into the possession of magical or mundane resources whose ownership is unclear or in dispute, and if no agreement can be had on the ownership of these resources, then the resources become the property of the Covenant and are held in common, precisely as if they had been donated. No compensation is owed to anyone in these cases.

  

## Membership Expectations

  

Councillors are entitled to food, drink, shelter, service by the Covenant's staff, and protection from its enemies. They are entitled to space in which to construct and maintain a laboratory, sanctum and additional facilities as required. They are entitled to borrow books from the Covenant's library, request funds, and request vis. Councillors are expected to safeguard the Covenant's resources, defend it from its enemies, and assist in the collection of vis and mundane finances as required. Activities which prevent or disrupt laboratory work for a season or more should be compensated with Portions, one for every season of work lost.

  

Councillors are required to spend one season every three years in service to the Covenant. The specific service will be determined by the Counsel and must be reasonable and within the capacity of each Councillor. If no service is specified by the end of the second year, the Councillor providing the service may opt to spend the season preparing a donation to the Covenant (such an item, laboratory texts or books for the library).

  

Councillors who fail to uphold the requirements of this charter can be censured by majority vote or expelled. Censured individuals lose access to all magical resources held by the Covenant, including vis, enchanted items, and books on non-mundane topics, but not to their laboratories, sanctums, or personal or mundane resources. Censure can last for a specific period or until rescinded by majority vote.

  

## Amending the Charter

  

This charter can be amended by a unanimous vote of the participating members, as defined under the rules for a quorum.

  

## Dissolution

  

In the event the Covenant should have no meetings for seven years, it shall be considered dissolved.
