The Roc, or the Roc of Notre-Dame, overlooks the city from 184 m (604 ft) above. It can be accessed from the centre of town behind the old Church of St. Andrew (Saint Andrè).

Two reservoirs are located in the territory of Castellane:

- Lake Castillon
- Lake Chaudanne, created by the dam of the same name, the Barrage de Chaudanne [fr].

The area has two water gaps:

- the clue de Taulanne containing the Asse de Blieux river and the Route Napoléon along its banks.
- the clue de Chasteuil, which contains the Verdon

Castellane's name appeared in texts for the first time circa 965–977 as Petra Castellana. The name breaks down into three Occitan terms, pèira, castel and the suffix -ana, which means fortified rock and village, and could be translated as "Castellane rock", in other words, the rock that has a fortified village,[11] or simply the stronghouse or stronghold. Castellane is called Castelana in the Provençal dialect in the classical norm, or Castelano in the Mistralian.

In 1189, Baron de Castellane Boniface III was attacked by Alfonso I of Provence. He had refused to do homage, explaining that he was a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire. But in the face of brute force he was forced to bend the knee. Another war broke out in 1227 between the Provence and Boniface of Castellane, presumably the son.[31] In 1257 Charles II—then still just prince of Salernes, gave the castle to the Austinian monks. In 1262, Charles I of Anjou defeated Boniface of Castellane and made Castelle the seat of a baile. In the thirteenth century, the family of Castellane lost possession of the city to the Counts of Provence. To protect themselves from attack, in addition to the protections for the city, Castellane built a series of fortified outposts at Demandolx, La Garde, Chasteuil [fr], Rougon, and perhaps Taloire.[when?] In 1300 a small Jewish community of eight households was established in the area.[32]
