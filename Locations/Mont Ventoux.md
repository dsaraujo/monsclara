![](Mont%20Ventoux.jpg)

The Mont Ventoux holds significant mystical significance according to the sources:

- It is known as the **"Home of the Winds"** and has a long-standing **evil reputation as the source of the Mistral, the famous wind of Provence**. This suggests a powerful connection to elemental forces, specifically air.
- The mountain possesses a **strong Magic aura that reaches level 7 on its upper slopes**, escalating into a **regio of level 9** as one ascends towards the summit. This indicates a potent concentration of magical energy.
- The **regio above the peak is inhabited by numerous air spirits** of varying Might, all under the dominion of a **greater Daimon referred to as Ventoux**. This entity periodically unleashes these lesser spirits, which reinforces the local folklore associating the mountain with malevolent forces.
- The **Source du Groseau**, a magical spring located on its lower slopes, is mentioned as a **potential source of Aquam vis**, further highlighting the mountain's magical nature and potential for vis extraction.
- The legends surrounding Mont Ventoux have attracted the attention of Hermetic magi. **Calais filius Septentrio of Bonisagus** has established his sanctum in a cave near the summit, with the goal of becoming the **Spirit Votary** of the daimon residing within. This signifies the mountain as a place of significant spiritual and magical power that magi seek to understand and connect with.
- Gaining access to the greater daimon or a potential **Faerie lord** of the mountain necessitates petitioning the **hostile Mistrau**. The challenge set by Mistrau involves capturing ephemeral concepts from Arcadia: the "last breath of Winter" and the "first exhalation of Spring", indicating a connection between Mont Ventoux and the Faerie realm.

- The sources also present the possibility that the spirit of Mont Ventoux, whether the daimon Ventoux or the Faerie lord Mistrau, could actually be an **Infernal spirit** seeking to corrupt both Hermetic and hedge elementalist traditions. In this scenario, a demon named Mistrau of the Order of Aerial Powers, whose influence is currently somewhat contained by the prayers of the monks at nearby Notre-Dame-du-Groseau, is a potential candidate.

In summary, Mont Ventoux is depicted as a powerful mystical site characterized by strong magical auras, a dominant spirit of the air, a potential connection to both the Faerie and Infernal realms, and an evil reputation linked to its powerful winds. It is a location that attracts magical interest and presents challenges for those seeking to interact with its supernatural forces.

## The Air Elementals (Zephyrus)

Zephyrus is the name given to an air elemental by members of the Order of Hermes, but they are also known as silvestres, sylphs, aeoliae (wind elementals), nenuphas (cloud elementals), and brontes (thunder and lightning elementals). Any air under the open sky or any natural weather phenomenon can produce a zephyrus. A zephyrus is composed of chains of octohedral corpuscles: in wind elementals, these chains form ropes; cloud elementals consist of interlocked loops; and a lightning elemental is a branched chain of scintillating energy.

Zephyri are utterly restless — they cannot remain still, even for a moment. They are travelers, moving through the world beneath the sky unless constrained by magic. They rarely descend from their lofty heights, but are occasionally curious about what is going on below them. They are highly perceptive, and are aware of everything going on around their home. They can sense the slightest movement of air from any direction, and are impossible to catch by surprise. They crave the disintegration of rigidity and barriers, and many are capable of dissolving structured matter.

A zephyrus' body is composed entirely of air. It is capable of moving through landscape unobstructed by other objects in its way, and can enter any space that is not air-tight. The speed of movement varies by elemental type: a mist elemental can roll at walking pace, whereas a lightning elemental is literally lightning fast. Weapons are meaningless to a creature with this power, they simply pass straight through. However, the elemental has no natural attack and must use its powers instead.

Curious about humans, especially after seeing them resisting their attacks.
### Ordeal

Once the location is found, Spatha must spend a full lunar cycle performing nightly vigils at the site. During these vigils, he must meticulously observe the movements of Mars (aligned to Ignem and Weapons, Armor and War). He is forbidden from using any magical means of enhancing his sight or understanding during this time, relying solely on his natural senses and mundane astronomical knowledge. This serves as a Minor Ordeal, representing the dedication and focused observation required.

Visão de proteção para a Ordem de Hermes.

Trials:

* **The shelter** from the wind chills of the Mistral. Even outside the depths of winter, temperatures on Mont Ventoux plummet at night. Without magical warming spells or enchanted gear, Spatha must rely entirely on mundane fire (challenging to maintain in the wind), warm clothing, and physical endurance to survive the cold and maintain his vigil. Hypothermia is a real, mundane threat.
* **Obscured Skies**: Clear nights are essential for astronomical observation, but mountain weather is notoriously fickle. Persistent cloud cover can completely obscure Mars for days on end, frustrating Spatha's efforts and testing his patience and dedication. He cannot magically disperse the clouds and must wait for nature's cooperation.
* Decoding the Martial Heavens Mundanely: The core of the Ordeal is relating the observations of Mars to its medieval astrological significance concerning Ignem, Weapons, Armor, and War. Spatha must draw upon his mundane knowledge of astrology and symbolism to interpret what the observed positions, brightness, and movements of Mars signify in relation to these concepts, and crucially, how they might apply to his own martial path and understanding of conflict, without resorting to magical divination or insights.
