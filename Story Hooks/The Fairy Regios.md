## Satyr Hollow (North Regio)

Near the place where the man was killed is the entrance to Satyr Hollow, where a small number of the goat-footed creatures of ancient myth still live in a free, comfortable band. Here they run at will through the forest, brawl with each other in sport, or nap under the trees while listening to their faerie pipes. They embody every kind of masculine leisure in the wild. The characters will be greeted by several surprised satyrs when they first arrive in the regio, who may abruptly challenge them to a wrestling match or invite them to accompany their hunt, as if this were the most natural thing in the world.

If the characters are threatening (have drawn weapons, for example) the satyrs may circle warily, pointing thick javelins at them and demanding to know their business. The creatures are not averse to a fight, as they haven’t had a good one in some time, but their numbers are waning and they fear unnecessary casualties. They would rather talk, but if the players want a battle it is easy to give them one here.

If the characters are easygoing and friendly, they will be offered wine and fruit. The satyrs have no leader, so this is more along the lines of one or two of them holding up their wineskins or gesturing to the drying figs on flat rocks. They will start to drink, carouse, and generally make merry, which may encourage the characters to join them. Characters with some knowledge of Faerie Lore may recognize this as dangerous, and you should warn characters with Common Sense that accepting food or drink from the fay is a bad idea.

The aura here is Faerie 3.

### The Elder Boch (North Regio)

The eldest satyr, who will introduce himself as Boch, will quietly make the characters’ acquaintance and take them aside once they have gotten comfortable. Older and wiser, he speaks the language much better than the others and bluntly asks the characters their business. If necessary, he will facilitate this discussion by playing a drowsy song on his pipes to calm down the rest after they have finished posturing for the newcomers. He assumes the characters have come here looking for the girl, and wants to head off a war without arousing the others’ suspicions.

He will admit that she is here if they ask after her, but explains that she is “needed,” and that she is their “wife.” He can tell the story of how they captured her and what happened during the conflict, and may explain what he can remember about the arrangement with the dryad, mentioned below, if the characters negotiate. If they insist on seeing her, he will take them to her, but cautions that the others are extremely protective of her, and that in any case she cannot leave, for she “belongs with us now.”

The girl is actually the daughter of the Baron of Castellane, Marie de Despare. The Satyrs don't know that.

## Queen Euryale (South Regio)

### The Hook: A Dream of Two Forests

The session begins not with a journey, but with a dream. Penelope, being a Merinita, is especially attuned to such things.

She dreams she is walking through the familiar woods behind the covenant. But with every step, the forest splits into two overlapping visions. In one version, the forest is ancient, serene, and dappled in soft moonlight. The air smells of damp earth and slumbering blossoms. This is the forest as it should be, **Allande's forest**.

In the other version, the vision is jarringly vibrant. Strange, brightly-colored fungi pulse with light, the trees are overgrown with foreign-looking bamboo, and the air is filled with the chattering of unseen monkeys and the scent of overripe, exotic fruit. This is the **Monkey King's forest**.

The two visions clash, creating a discordant and unsettling dreamscape. Penelope awakens with a clear, urgent feeling: the forest is at war with itself, and she is being called to witness it.

---

### Act I: The Contested Wood

Upon entering the forest, Penelope will find her dream was a literal truth. The forest is now a patchwork of two conflicting realities.

- **Zones of Influence:** Some areas feel ancient and calm (Allande's influence is returning), while others are chaotic and alien (the Monkey King's influence reigns). Traveling from one zone to another is jarring. A quiet oak grove might suddenly give way to a noisy bamboo thicket filled with mischievous, chattering monkey-fae who try to steal small items or lead travelers astray.
    
- **The Wild Card:** As Penelope navigates this confusion, a familiar, annoying buzz sounds by her ear. **Mixlyx the imp** appears, looking more harried than usual. He is no longer in the Monkey King's service but is now a desperate free agent, trying to survive in the shifting political landscape. He can serve as an unreliable narrator, explaining the situation for a price (a bit of vis, a promise of protection, or a particularly shiny bauble).
    
    - **Mixlyx's Exposition:** He'll explain that Allande is awake and her power is slowly seeping back into the forest from her regio. The Monkey King, furious at this silent rebellion, is doubling down, trying to overwrite the forest's native story with his own tale of glorious chaos. The two are in a "cold war," and every lesser fae is being forced to choose a side.
        

---

### Act II: An Audience with Two Monarchs

Mixlyx, seeing an opportunity, will offer to guide Penelope to see both "monarchs," arguing that she is the only one who might be able to speak to both.

- **The Court of the Monkey King:** His "court" is a garish, hastily-built pagoda in the highest branches of the forest, loud with the sound of gongs and the screeching of his followers. The Monkey King is as arrogant and boisterous as ever.
    
    - **His Perspective:** He sees Penelope's arrival as a boon. He views Allande as a "boring traditionalist" who wants to put the forest "to sleep." He argues that his rule brings excitement, growth, and novelty.
        
    - **His Offer:** He will try to recruit Penelope. "Join me, little dream-spinner! Together, we will make this forest a legend! No more quiet slumber—only adventure! Help me drive out the old queen, and I will grant you a title in my court, teach you the secret paths between stories, and give you vis of such vibrant imagination you have never dreamed of!"
        
- **The Court of Allande:** Getting to Allande requires finding the hidden entrance to her regio, perhaps at the base of the oldest tree or behind a waterfall. Inside, the regio is a place of timeless beauty and tranquility—a perfect, idyllic glade under a sky of twilight stars. Allande is now fully recovered: regal, serene, and radiating a quiet, immense power.
    
    - **Her Perspective:** She is deeply grateful to Penelope but also deeply concerned. The Monkey King's chaotic story is like a poison, she explains. It creates short-term vibrancy but will ultimately exhaust and unravel the forest's ancient magic.
        
    - **Her Offer:** She will appeal to Penelope's wisdom and their past alliance. "You helped me once, storyteller. Now, I ask for your aid again. The Usurper's tale is a loud and violent one that will burn itself out, and the forest with it. Help me restore the true, deep story of this place. If you do, the forest will not just be your neighbor, but your ally. I can grant you knowledge of its oldest secrets, safe passage through any wood, and vis born of deep roots and starlight."

### Act III: The Storyteller's Choice

Penelope is now the fulcrum upon which the fate of the forest rests. The session's climax is her decision. She is not being asked to fight a physical battle, but to choose which **story** she will help write.

1. **Side with Allande:** The task would be to weaken the Monkey King's narrative. Allande might ask Penelope to enter the dreams of the forest's most ancient inhabitants (like a slumbering badger-fae or the spirit of the oldest oak) and "reawaken" their memories of the true forest, strengthening Allande's power base.
    
2. **Side with the Monkey King:** The task would be to disrupt Allande's growing power. The Monkey King might ask Penelope to craft a powerful dream—a "story-weapon"—of a great fire or a flood, and "plant" it in the forest's consciousness, creating fear and chaos that only his dynamic rule can solve.
    
3. **Attempt to Mediate:** Penelope could try to forge a new narrative where both can coexist. This is the most difficult path. Could she create a dream where the Monkey King is not a usurper, but a "Summer Guardian" who brings vibrancy, while Allande is the "Winter Queen" who brings rest and recovery? This would require immense skill and could anger both monarchs if they feel their story has been compromised.
    

The session can end as Penelope makes her choice and prepares to undertake the task she has been given. The fate of the forest now rests, in no small part, on her loom of dreams.

# Alternativa

### 1. O Conceito: O que é o "Alinhamento"?

Baseado na natureza de Ninip e no conhecimento recém-adquirido de Spatha em _Celestial Magic_1, o "alinhamento" não é apenas geográfico, mas metafísico.

- **A Teoria do Espelho Celeste:** Ninip vem das esferas celestiais, onde tudo é ordem, matemática e luz. Para ela, Mons Clara e seus arredores deveriam ser um reflexo imperfeito, mas funcional, das constelações acima.
    
- **Os Pontos de Acupuntura da Terra:** O "alinhamento" significa restaurar o fluxo de _Vis_ ou a estabilidade da Aura Mágica conectando pontos específicos na terra que correspondem a estrelas específicas no céu. Ninip vê a magia como geometria.
    
- **O Problema:** A guerra féerica na floresta está distorcendo a realidade. As fadas moldam o mundo baseadas em histórias, emoções e narrativas, o que é anátema para a precisão estelar de Ninip. Onde deveria haver uma linha reta de poder mágico, agora há uma curva narrativa criada pelo capricho do Rei Macaco ou da Rainha Alande.
    

### 2. A Relação com o Caos Férico

A briga entre o Rei Macaco e a Rainha Alande 2 é o obstáculo direto.

- **Natureza do Conflito:** O Rei Macaco quer domínio através da força e do "sangue", enquanto a Rainha Alande (antiga deusa das nascentes) quer beleza e odeia pedras3.
    
- **A Ameaça de Ninip:** Ninip chegou em um meteoro (uma pedra do céu)4. Para a Rainha Alande, Ninip é a representação suprema do que ela detesta: uma "pedra" fria, lógica e alienígena invadindo seu reino aquático e fluido.
    
- **O Ponto de Alinhamento:** Ninip provavelmente precisa colocar um marcador (talvez um pedaço do meteoro ou suas teias de prata 5) em um local que agora é um campo de batalha ou um local sagrado para as fadas.
    

---

### 3. Estrutura da Sessão: Investigação e Diplomacia (ou Guerra)

Sugiro dividir a sessão em três atos para explorar essa tensão.

#### Ato I: O Mapa de Luz (No Laboratório de Spatha)

- **Cena:** Spatha, Damon (para tradução) e Ninip no observatório à noite6.
    
- **A Revelação:** Ninip projeta um mapa estelar sobre a mesa, mas sobrepõe o mapa da floresta. Um ponto brilha intensamente, pulsando em vermelho ou "erro". Ninip comunica que a "Estrela de [Nome de uma estrela relevante, ex: Antares]" não consegue tocar o solo porque a "névoa do caos" (a aura féerica instável) está bloqueando-a.
    
- **O Objetivo:** Ninip precisa que Spatha leve um de seus "ovos" (ou cristais do geodo) 7 até o coração do território disputado para ancorar a luz da estrela. Damon traduz conceitos complexos de "retificação geométrica".
    

#### Ato II: A Floresta Distorcida (A Investigação)

- **O Ambiente:** Ao entrarem na floresta, a atmosfera mudou desde a última visita. Não é apenas agressiva8; é surreal.
    
    - _Exemplo:_ Árvores crescendo de cabeça para baixo (influência do Rei Macaco zombando da ordem) ou riachos correndo para cima (influência da Rainha).
        
- **O Encontro com Mixlyx:** O servo férico está ainda mais desesperado9. Ele pode revelar que o local que Ninip quer "alinhar" é sagrado para ambos os lados.
    
    - _O Local:_ Pode ser a "Árvore Antiga coberta de teias da aranha Lulu"10. Ninip pode ver as teias da aranha féerica como uma "tentativa falha e orgânica" de copiar suas teias de prata perfeitas e celestiais.
        
- **Interação:** Se Spatha trouxer Ninip (talvez escondida, pois ela evita o dia 11), a criatura reagirá com hostilidade fria à "imperfeição" das fadas.
    

#### Ato III: O Trilema no Ponto de Alinhamento

Eles chegam ao local. É uma clareira onde a realidade está tênue.

- **O Conflito:**
    
    1. **O Rei Macaco** enviou seus súditos para destruir o local ou transformá-lo em um trono de ossos.
        
    2. **A Rainha Alande** está tentando inundar o local para torná-lo uma fonte, purificando-o de qualquer "pedra".
        
    3. **Ninip** exige que uma estrutura de metal estelar ou cristal seja erguida ali para "fixar" a realidade.
        
- **O Dilema de Spatha:**
    
    - Apoiar Ninip fortalece a Aura Mágica, mas enfurece ambas as cortes féericas, possivelmente unindo-as contra o Covenant.
        
    - Apoiar um dos lados féericos pode ganhar um aliado, mas Ninip considerará isso uma "falha lógica" e poderá perder a confiança em Spatha ou tentar agir sozinha (o que seria desastroso).
        
    - _Opção Criativa:_ Spatha pode usar _Celestial Magic_ para convencer as fadas de que o alinhamento estelar as glorifica (ex: "Esta estrela será a coroa da Rainha"), usando a lábia de Damon ou Themis (se presente).
        

### Detalhes Adicionais para Enriquecer

- **O Professor Damon:** Use-o não apenas como tradutor, mas como alguém fascinado. Ele pode notar paralelos entre Ninip e lendas gregas de autômatos de Hefesto12, sugerindo que o que está no portão da montanha e Ninip podem ter origens cósmicas similares.
    
- **As Teias:** Ninip construiu um tubo de teias de prata no laboratório13. Na floresta, a aranha Lulu (do Mixlyx) tem teias mágicas14. Um duelo de tecelões (ordem vs caos) seria temático e visualmente incrível.
    
- **O Elemento Pedra:** Lembre-se que a Rainha Alande detesta pedra15. Ninip veio de um meteoro (pedra) e Spatha é um mago que lida com armaduras e forja. A Rainha é a antagonista natural aqui.
    

Próximo Passo Sugerido:

Gostaria que eu gerasse alguns diálogos possíveis entre Damon traduzindo os pensamentos abstratos de Ninip para explicar por que o alinhamento é vital para a segurança do Covenant (talvez para estabilizar a Aura que alimenta a Gorgon presa)?

#### 1. The Presentation (The Artisan's Pride)

Spatha stands before her, holding the horseshoes. These are not merely iron; they are likely crafted with silver inlays, etched with runes of stability and speed, perhaps quenched in water from the covenant's own magical spring.

- **Epona's Reaction:** She does not dismount. She circles him, her horse snorting (animals usually hate the Gift, but her steed is immune or controlled by her will). She looks down, her eyes like dark pools.
    
    > _"You bring iron to the mistress of the wild, Smith. Does it bite, or does it sing?"_
    
- **The Test:** She demands he show the quality not by explaining it, but by _listening_. When he strikes the shoes together, they should ring with a pure, bell-like tone that cuts through the mist, silencing the birds.

	Orleia, the mare

#### 2. The Fitting (The Physical Trial)

This is the true challenge. Epona gestures to her mare.

- **The Challenge:** _"If they are worthy, they will hold the Earth without binding the Wind. Shoe her."_
    
- Spatha must approach the massive, magical beast. This is dangerous. The horse radiates raw power (Magic or Faerie aura).
    
- **Mechanical Check:** This isn't just Craft; it’s **Animal Handling** (or a brave _Presence_ check). If Spatha flinches, the mare might kick or bite. He must trust his craft to protect him.
    
    - _Narrative detail:_ As he nails the shoe (or magically fuses it, depending on his method), the iron shouldn't smell of burning hoof; it should smell of **ozone and rain**.
        

#### 3. The Transformation

Once the shoes are fitted, the mare rears up.

- **The Miracle:** When the hooves strike the muddy ground, they do not sink. Instead, the water freezes or solidifies momentarily under the impact (a visual representation of the _Terra_ form Spatha excels in).
    
- **Epona’s Verdict:** She laughs—a sound like a rushing river.
    
    > _"You have bound the mountain's strength to the ocean's speed. You are a worthy maker."_
    

### The Reward (Boons & Hooks)

Epona will not pay in coin. She pays in **myth**.

- **Option A: The Path of the Centaur (Insight)** She whispers a secret about the structure of bodies and movement. This grants Spatha **XP towards a Muto or Animal breakthrough**, or perhaps a **Laboratory Text** for a spell that allows a mount to travel tirelessly (_The Steed of Unflagging Stride_).
    
- **Option B: The Foal of the Mist (Companion/Resource)** She leaves behind a single foal from her herd. This is a magical beast (Magic Might). It could be a new **Mount** for Spatha (who struggles with normal horses due to the Gift) or a source of **Animal Vis** (if shed hairs are collected).
    
    - _Hook:_ The foal requires a diet of Vis or special care, becoming a project for Spatha or an Animal specialist.
        
- **Option C: The Iron Pact (Story Hook)** She accepts the shoes but tells him they have a specific number of "strikes."
    
    > _"These shoes will carry me across the sky for a year and a day. When they wear thin, the Wild Hunt will ride to your forge again. Be ready."_ This creates a recurring **Faerie Friend** or **Ally** dynamic, but also a deadline for a future favor.
    

### Storyguide Tip: The Twist

If you want to add a Verditius flavor to the drama, have Spatha notice a **flaw** in his own work as the horse gallops away—a tiny hairline fracture or a rune that didn't set perfectly. Epona doesn't notice, but _he_ does. This triggers his **Verditius Hubris** or **Perfectionism**, haunting him despite the success.
