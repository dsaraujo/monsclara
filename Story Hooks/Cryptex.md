[Tibaut ex Guernicus](Tibaut%20ex%20Guernicus.md) discovered the truth about [Dama ex Merinita](Dama%20ex%20Merinita.md), but cannot confront her familiar, Maju, by himself. So he sent a secret message to Mons Clara asking for help in a Cryptex that can only be solved by knowledge from its members. To solve the Cryptex, they need:

* The position of Venus during the first Aegis cast in Mons Clara in 1220, known by Spatha.
* The data of birth of Benoit, known by Spatha and Benoit
* The fear of births, known by Penelope
* The fist animal found in Mons Clara (Turtle), known by Luc

Due to her relationship with the cult, Tibaut don't trust Drusilla, and he doesn't know that Benoit is banished.

Tibaut reveals that is preparing hidden in the outskirts of Mimizan, waiting for the perfect time to strike. He discovered that Dama's longevity ritual is almost failing, and she will move to Aedes Mercurii tio procure Ophilios help at any time now, likely in the Spring of 1230. He wants to ambush her on the way. He asks the covenant to destroy the message once read, and that they do not trust any member of the cult (including Beatrice and Drusilla).
