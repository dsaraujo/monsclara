Dead/Ghost sodales? Inspiration? Sonambulism?

Someone leaves notes in the magus' lab, aiding his work (add to Lab Total). Who was it, why did it choose to aid his research, and most importantly - how did it get in?

(Maybe a escaped dream?)

---

Raw vis that has long been used by the covenant is discovered to be Infernally tainted. When was it tainted, and are the old magics relying on it reliable?

---

A Wealthy merchant asks the covenant to hide one of his daughters.

---

Visits from the other covenants. Praeco? Chief Quaesitor?

---

A magus who has no particular gift in Laboratory work is surprised to learn that he has won an award for his amazing magical device...that he's never heard of. Perhaps the next surprise will be a Wizard War declared by the actual owner, thinking the magus stole his Lab Notes.

---

One of the Covenfolk has a near death experience and converts to the local religion. They become more and more devoted, threatening the Covenant's routine. If properly handled this could be a postive thing, but most Magi are leery of the Divine, especially so close to home.

---

A character's intelligent familiar falls in love with a visiting wizard's familiar.

---

New stars are visible in the sky, every astrologer flees in terror. In your covenant an albino child has just been born. Are the two related?

---

Your Pater's covenant has collasped. He, his peers and the surviving members of the covenant show up at his favorite students door. They are moving in.

---

**The Golden Fleece of Provence?:** Shepherds in Arelat sometimes find strands of golden wool that Hermetic magi recognize as Imaginem-flavored Accrued vis. The Coenobium might task the magi of Mons Clara with finding this wool in exchange for access to their resources or membership**4**.

---

**A Troubadour Seeking Magical Aid:** A troubadour might ask the magi of Mons Clara for help winning the love of a lady, composing a particularly moving song, or protecting themselves from a jealous rival.

---

There is a thief on the covenant.  The covenfolk wants to exile the thief,  but this can be dangerous for the magi.

## Travelling

**The Shadow of the Crusade:** The road is shared with a small band of refugees, their clothes ragged and their eyes full of fear. They are fleeing from the north, from the ongoing persecutions of those with "unorthodox beliefs." They are starving and desperate. Shortly after encountering them, Spatha's group is stopped by a patrol of knights, grim-faced and zealous, led by a minor lord loyal to the French crown. They are hunting heretics and ask pointed questions about anyone seen on the road. Protecting the refugees would be dangerous, but turning a blind eye feels cruel. This choice will have consequences, especially in a Tribunal as religiously charged as Provence.

**The Toll of the River Lord:** To cross the Durance river without a long detour, the party must use a ferry owned by a petty, arrogant local lord. He demands a toll, not in coin, but in a service or an item. Seeing Spatha's fine gear, he might demand an enchanted item or, hearing of his skills, demand that Spatha repair a complex siege engine or design a novel irrigation system for his fields. Refusal means a dangerous, multi-day detour through bandit-infested marshland. This is a classic feudal challenge, as detailed in _Fief_.
