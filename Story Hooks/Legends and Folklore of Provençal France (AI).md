The sources offer numerous examples of local legends and folklore of Provençal France, with a particular focus on the magical and supernatural:

- **Giants:** The jentilak are giants from Basque mythology who are said to have predated humans. The sources credit them with teaching the Basques essential skills like tool use, agriculture, and metallurgy. Legends suggest they built the megalithic structures found throughout the region and even fought alongside the Basques against Charlemagne's army at the Battle of Roncevaux. While mostly extinct, some jentilak are said to live in the remote areas of the Pyrenees.
    
- **Fairies:** Provençal France teems with fairies, often presented as mischievous and sometimes dangerous creatures. The sources describe them inhabiting various locales, including dolmens, caves, and even specific trees.
    
    - **The Dames Blanches:** This group of fairies dwells in the Médoc region, luring pilgrims astray on the Way of St. James.
    - **Oriande la Fée:** This fairy queen rules a realm in the Médoc, residing in a magnificent, hidden castle called Rosefleur.
    - **Maju:** This ancient, powerful fairy disguises itself and manipulates those seeking power, as seen in its relationship with Dama ex Merinita.
- **Dragons:** Dragons, both real and imagined, feature in several stories:
    
    - **Lehen Sugea:** This seven-headed, flying, fire-breathing dragon from Basque mythology sleeps within Mount Rhune.
    - **The Lou Carcolh:** This monstrous beast terrorizes the area near Bayonne, preying on pilgrims traveling the Way of St. James. Local folk witches appease the creature with sacrifices, sometimes manipulating others into becoming its prey.
    - **The Drac:** Legends in Arelat describe a shapeshifting, sorcerer-dragon that dwells in the Rhone River, preying on those who live near the water. While many believe it to be a myth, recent disappearances suggest it may have returned.
- **The Tarasque:** This legendary creature, described as a six-legged amphibian beast, terrorized the region until St. Martha subdued it. While villagers later killed the Tarasque, its lair near Tarascon is still said to hold magical power, potentially sheltering lesser versions of the creature.
    
- **Lost Treasures:** Tales of lost treasures abound, including:
    
    - **The Treasure of the Lake of Toulouse:** This treasure, offered to a spirit inhabiting a lake to ward off pestilence, was stolen by a Roman governor. After the Tolosates revolted and killed the governor, the treasure vanished, with some believing it came into the possession of the Cathars.
    - **The Treasure of the Sack of Rome:** The sources mention riches seized during the Sack of Rome, including artifacts from the Temple in Jerusalem, were brought to Toulouse and subsequently lost.
    - **Ogier the Dane's Sword:** Cortana, the famed sword of Ogier the Dane (a paladin of Charlemagne), is missing from its resting place in the church at Belin.
    - **The Golden Goat’s Treasure:** Legend has it, the Le Chevre d’Or, a magical golden goat, guards a cave containing the vast treasure of its father, a Caliph of Cordoba.
- **Other Magical Tales**:
    
    - **The Ghosts of the Garagai Gorge:** After the Battle of Aquae Sextiae in 102 BC, the Roman general Marius ordered the slaughter of 300 Teutonic chieftains in the Garagai Gorge. Their vengeful spirits, more akin to magical entities than infernal beings, are said to haunt the location, potentially offering clues to a lost magical tradition.
    - **The Robes of Dusty Dawn:** These legendary robes, rumored to grant great power, are said to be hidden in a remote castle, guarded by a fearsome giant. The robes' magical nature supposedly makes it impossible to wear them, touch them, or even approach them too closely.

The sources emphasize the importance of legends and stories, particularly within House Merinita. They suggest some stories might be more than mere tales, potentially representing historical events, glimpses into the Faerie realm, or even prophecies of the future. This adds another dimension to the legends and folklore of Provençal France, suggesting a deeper connection between stories and the magical reality of the setting.
