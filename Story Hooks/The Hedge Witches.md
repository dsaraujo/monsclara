Group of hedge wizards circa Castellane that were scared of Benoit and the magi of Mons Clara.  [Isilda](Isilda.md) was controlled by Sybil and remember the situation clearly. Tres ex Miscellanea contacted them later and might make them join him and the "House" Miscellanea, possible establishing a new covenant.

They were collecting magical energy to charge their charged items from the `Water sound` vis source for the last few years.

By the end of 1220, in the Winter, [[Lavandarius]], the Pralician, explains to them that they are not under the protection of Ceonobium, and Mons Clara will be responsible for them. They should keep protecting the source, they should be able to keep charging their magical items there. They should also keep bringing their children to be tested on the presence of the Gift.

When the group comes back to the source, this time they met with Isilda's mom, that might explain more their group. Her name is Margot, and she is the only Gifted folk witch. They are Folk Witches of the Coven of Eos, an aspect of Aurora, the Roman goddess of dawn, named Mater Matuta, ou a mãe.

She also tells them that they will also get any "marked" children, like Levandarius took them. He just did that, and they do not expect another one to be born soon. They are known as children of the day stars, and are only born when stars appears in the day (eclipses and winter solstice).

Folk Witches have the following abilities when have their "arts" opened: Animal Ken, Healing, Cursing, Dowsing, Flight, Second Sight and Shapeshifting. UnGifted witches usually only have one of those (sometimes two).

Mirina is lastest child to be born. She does not have the Gift.

Lisanda, born in 1224, during the Eclipse is Gifted. She would be presented in [1229](1229.md).
