The Glamour enchantment (see page 101 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) inside this bag makes the space inside it far bigger than it should be. More than 200 liters would fit into it, but because the weight isn’t reduced there is still a limit on the wielder. You could put a whole human body inside this bag, if you could bear its weight. If you’re searching for something inside it, you could be forced to crawl into it.
