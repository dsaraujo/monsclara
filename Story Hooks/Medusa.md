Stheno is her name. She is sister of Allande, aka Divona for the Gauls, or Euryle for the Greek before.

Julius locked Stheno and Allande. Stehno can sense everything that the stone touches, that is why he build his lab inside a mental projection.

Might: 50. She is part of the [[Aura of Mons Clara]]. Over a hundred years of lack of devotion and outside of a Fairy Realm, Stheno transformed into a Magic Spirit of Earth. 

Bound by ancient relics of Greece: 

**The Ancient Locus:** That iron door and the throne behind it... they are likely not Julius's creations. He _found_ them. This chamber is an ancient _locus_, a place where a Greek myth resonates with terrible power. The "throne" is not a seat of power, but a **vessel of binding**, perhaps a shard of Tartarus or a trap forged by Hephaestus himself, waiting for its quarry. The door has a ReVi Effect of Level 60. [[The Shard of Tartarus]].

Julius used his strong Mentem powers to convince Divona that her story was to be rescued by a hero wielding the Aegis of Athena, and empower the Aura of Mons Clara. The bounds are weakened during the Sun and Moon eclipses, due to flaws in the magic of the door, and that is why the aura "leaks". They were made using Symbolic magic, tied to the iron doors (Symbol Duration).

She also is responsible for the stone hearts on Twins, due to her story of rivalry with her own sister, Allande.

### 2. The Consequence of Freedom

If that iron door is breached, if the Hermetic seal is broken... it will not be a simple release. It will be a _catastrophe_.

- **The Shattered Narrative:** Breaking the seal _shatters_ the Mentem-fueled narrative Julius imposed. Stheno would be freed not only physically, but _mentally_. The sudden, violent realization of her millennia-long deception would unleash a rage of primordial scale.
    
- **The Eruption of Power:** The "leak" of Terram aura would become a _deluge_. The mountain would not just be a source of magic; it would _become_ Stheno's rage. Expect the ground to tremble. Cracks of raw Terram _vis_ might split the earth. The very stones of Mons Clara could cry out.
    
- **The Creeping Stone:** Stheno _is_ a Gorgon. Her freedom would unleash her most infamous power, but perhaps not as a simple gaze. It might manifest as a _wave_ of petrification rolling down the mountain. The forests turn to stone, the streams (Allande's domain!) become choked with silt and cease to flow. This creates an _immediate_ and dire conflict with her sister, the Queen of the Spring.

This would be a very strong effect: MuTe(CoAqAnHe) 80 (Base 25, +4 Arcane Connection, +3 Moon, +4 Boundary). This spends 16 Might points. Everyone affected also gets one warping point. Due to the high level power, the effect has 0 penetration and will unlikely effect the magi, magical creatures and fairies. Covenfolks would be all affected (with the exception of Esther and Brother Adrien ). Sera is affected if she is the covenant.
    
- **A Target:** Her first act, after the initial explosion of power, would be vengeance. Vengeance upon the covenant that sits atop her prison, the inheritors of Julius's legacy.

### 3. The Aegis of Athena

Here, Storyguide, is the crucial key. You are wise to recall Penelope's dream. The Aegis of Athena is not a weapon to _defeat_ Stheno, for she cannot be defeated by such means. It is a tool of _wisdom_ and _reflection_.

- **Perseus's Tool:** In the legend, Athena's polished shield (the Aegis) allowed Perseus to see Medusa _indirectly_, to behold her without falling to her power.
    
- **Its True Purpose:** Penelope's dream is a warning and a guide. The "Aegis" is the magi's _only_ way to confront Stheno _safely_. It is not a physical shield, but a **ritual** or **understanding** they must achieve.
    
- **Seeing the Lie:** The Aegis is the key to _unraveling_ Julius's Mentem "trick." It is a potent **Intellego** magic (perhaps $InMe$ or $InVi$, or even a Faerie mystery) that will allow the magi to _perceive_ the narrative prison for what it is. It will allow them to _see the lie_ that binds Stheno.
    
- The Path to Resolution: Spatha, now armed with Greek, cannot simply walk in and speak to her. Her mind is clouded, imprisoned by Julius's deception. If they break the door, she is freed in rage.
    
    But if they first use the "Aegis" (which Penelope must perhaps first research or create), they can project the truth to Stheno. They can show her the reflection of her imprisonment.
