### **Alphyn, the Mountain Guardian**

The alphyn is a fearsome and intelligent magical beast, guarding the ancient mountain pass where it dwells. Enraged by the frequent passage of travelers, particularly those bearing symbols it finds offensive, it is a formidable opponent that cannot be easily dispatched through brute force alone.

- **Powers**:
    - **Terrifying Roar**, 4 points, Init +0, Mentem: The alphyn can let out a **thunderous roar** that strikes deep fear into all who hear it within Voice range. Overcoming this fear completely requires a **Brave roll against an Ease Factor of 12**. Those who fail this roll are struck with panic and will attempt to flee by the quickest, most feasible means possible.
    - **Guardian’s Vigil**, 2 points, constant, Intellego Animal/Imaginem: The alphyn possesses a **constant, supernatural awareness** of all creatures and significant objects passing through its mountain pass. It can discern the general nature of travelers (e.g., human, animal, magical, mundane) and may subtly **detect unusual or "offensive" symbols or intentions** carried by them. This functions as a continuous Intellego Animal/Imaginem effect with an effective level of 20.
    - **Resilient Form**, 3 points, constant, Animal: The alphyn's form is supernaturally tough, making it **incredibly difficult to harm** and contributing to its "cannot be simply slain" nature. It gains an **additional +3 bonus to its Soak score** and possesses a minor resistance to mundane forms of attack.
    - **Venomous Bite**, 0 Points, Init +0, Animal: When the alphyn’s bite attacks, compare its Attack Advantage to the victim’s armor Protection (not Soak). If the serpent’s advantage is higher, the victim suffers the effects of adder venom as listed in the Poison Table (ArM5, page 180), regardless of whether the bite inflicts an actual wound. The Storyguide may adjust the victim’s effective Protection for special circumstances.
- **Natural Weapons**: **Spiny Mane** (If an opponent strikes the alphyn with a bite, claw, or fist attack, they suffer +5 damage in return from its dragon-like mane spines).
    
- **Equipment**: None.
    
- **Encumbrance**: 0 (0).
    
- **Vis**: 4 pawns of Animal vis, concentrated in its heart.
    
- **Appearance**: The alphyn possesses the powerful, sinewy body of a large, dark-furred wolf (Size +1). Its coat is bristly and somewhat scaly, hinting at its draconic heritage. Its forelegs end in powerful, sharp talons, reminiscent of a majestic eagle, capable of gripping and tearing. A thick, scaly mane, like that of a dragon, runs down its neck and back, glinting ominously in the light. Its eyes glow with a keen, discerning intelligence. It moves with a predatory grace, but when enraged, its movements become fierce and direct.
    
- **Magic Resistance**: 24.
