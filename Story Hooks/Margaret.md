### I. The Nature of the Adversary

The letter from Rixenda spoke of "political enemies" and "magical interference." These are but shadows on a wall; it is time to give them form and substance. The true threat should not be a random beast, but a force with a clear and compelling motive to disrupt this union.

- **A Rival Covenant's Gambit:** Rixenda is on the "losing side of the last court intrigue." Who was on the winning side? I propose the **Covenant of Castra Solis**, known rivals in the Provençal Tribunal. Perhaps they are allied with a noble house that would have benefited from a different match for Margaret. Their motive is twofold: to further embarrass Rixenda and her allies (including now, Mons Clara) and to gain favor with a competing political faction, perhaps agents of the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, who often contends with the French crown.
    - **Their Method:** They would not act openly. Instead, they might employ subtle magic: a curse to make Margaret appear unwell and unsuitable upon her arrival, enchantments on the roads to cause delays and accidents, or magically-influenced bandits to harass the convoy, making the Queen's knight seem incompetent.
        
- **The Pride of the Fae:** A royal procession, filled with high emotion, is a veritable feast for the Fair Folk. The journey passes through ancient lands, and a local Faerie lord might take offense at the lack of tribute or acknowledgment.
    - **The Encounter:** Near Sisteron, where the mountains rise, the convoy could enter a regio. The road ahead and behind vanishes, replaced by an impossibly beautiful forest. The Fae Lord does not necessarily wish harm but demands a boon or a contest of wits. Penelope's social graces would be tested here, for a diplomatic failure could trap them for years or turn the Fae truly hostile. What if the Lord demands the "most beautiful song ever heard" or a "story that can make a stone weep" in exchange for passage?
        
- **An Infernal Temptation:** Where great political shifts occur, the agents of Hell are never far. A minor demon, perhaps a tempter in the guise of a traveling friar or a disgruntled servant in Margaret's entourage, could be sowing discord.
    - **The Scheme:** Its goal is not to kill Margaret, but to corrupt the union. It might whisper poison into the knight's ear, making him paranoid about the magi. It could attempt to tempt one of the player characters, offering power or knowledge in exchange for a "small" compromise in their duty. This presents a moral and ethical challenge, not just a physical one.

### II. The Journey's Trials

The path from Forcalquier to Lyon is more than a line on a map. Each stage should present a unique challenge that allows different characters to shine.

- **Forcalquier to Barjols (The Departure):** The first leg is about setting the tone. As the convoy assembles, there is an opportunity for social interaction.
    
    - **Scene:** Penelope must navigate the complex etiquette of Margaret's court-in-exile. A seemingly innocent conversation with a lady-in-waiting could reveal a rumor or a threat. Is one of Margaret's own retinue a spy? Use a tense scene where the Queen's knight, **Sir Kylan**, openly shows his distrust of the "witchcraft" the magi represent, forcing Penelope to win him over or work around him.
        
- **Barjols to Digne (The Road of Whispers):** This region is known for its quiet villages and deep woods. Here, the threat should be subtle and mysterious.
    
    - **Encounter:** The convoy finds a small, abandoned village. The inhabitants are not dead but are frozen in place, as if time has stopped. This is the work of a magical trap, perhaps laid by Castra Solis, meant to delay the party indefinitely. Luc and Themis must use their magical senses and knowledge to unravel the enchantment without harming the innocents. This is not a battle of fire, but a complex magical puzzle.
        
- **Digne to Sisteron (The Shadow of the Mountains):** The landscape becomes wilder, more primal. This is where a supernatural creature could strike.
    
    - **Encounter:** An **[[Alphyn]]**, a creature with the body of a wolf, the forelegs of an eagle, and a dragon's mane, attacks the convoy. It is not merely a beast but a magical guardian of the mountain pass, enraged by the passage of so many. It is intelligent and cannot be simply slain. The party must find what has angered it—perhaps the knight's banner bears a symbol offensive to it—and negotiate or perform a service to appease it.

- **Sisteron to Lyon (The Final Gambit):** The enemy is growing desperate. The final leg of the journey is where they will launch their most direct assault.
    
    - **Climax:** An ambush orchestrated by the rival covenant's agents. They use mundane soldiers enhanced with magical strength and speed, led by a minor magus or a skilled hedge wizard. This is where the copper crosses created by Drusilla become crucial. When the lead enemy mage casts a spell at Sir Kylan, the cross flares brightly, absorbing the magic but shattering in the process. It is a clear sign of the potent magic at play and a moment for Drusilla's foresight to be celebrated, even in her absence.

### III. The Souls on the Road

Flesh out the non-player characters to make the world feel alive.

- **Margaret of Provence:** She is only fourteen. She is likely a mix of fear and duty. Does she show moments of childishness? Or does she possess a quiet, steely resolve that surprises everyone? Give her a secret: perhaps she has a minor magical Gift herself, one she tries to hide, or she is terrified of a prophecy she once heard about her marriage. This makes protecting _her_, not just the political asset, the central goal.

- **Sir Kylan, the Queen's Knight:** Do not make him a simple fool. He is a devout, competent, and brave knight who believes utterly in God and his Queen. Magic is, to him, the work of the Devil. He sees the magi as a necessary evil at best. The challenge for the players is to earn his respect, not through displays of raw power, but through their wisdom, subtlety, and shared commitment to protecting Margaret. By the end of the journey, he should see them not as witches, but as strange and powerful allies.

Prepare these encounters, wise Storyguide, but hold them lightly. The players will inevitably surprise you. Your role is to present a living world full of danger and wonder, and to watch as their legend unfolds upon it. The road to Lyon is waiting.

### I. The Immediate Scene: The Court of the Count

The last session ended at a moment of great tension and opportunity. Sir Kylan has ordered preparations to depart, and Margaret of Provence herself has appeared. This is the critical moment where the magi must solidify their place within the escort.

- **The Introduction to the Princess:** Themis, in his guise as Sir Poulain de Castellane, must now formally address Margaret and the Seneschal. This is a pivotal social encounter. How does Margaret, a girl of fifteen, react to this stranger offering his sword? Is she gracious, suspicious, or perhaps intrigued? Does the Seneschal accept Themis's credentials, or does he require further proof of his "divine mission from the crown"?
    
- **Defining the Roles:** With departure imminent, Sir Kylan will establish a chain of command. He is the "regent's knight" and clearly in charge of the mundane escort. Where do the magi fit? Spatha and Drusilla, disguised as a guard and servant, should seek out their counterparts among the retinue. This is a chance to gather information from the common folk—what are the rumors among the guards? Do Margaret's handmaidens have fears about the journey?
    
- **The Owl's Vantage Point:** Do not forget Luc, who planned to take the form of an owl. From the ramparts or a stable beam, he can be the unseen observer. Can he overhear a private conversation between Sir Kylan and the Seneschal? Does he notice anyone in the crowd observing the magi with undue interest—perhaps the curious little boy from before?
    

### II. Lingering Threads from the Road

Before the journey to Lyon fully commences, there are unresolved matters that may resurface.

- **The Shadow of the Friar:** Themis has an arcane connection to the preacher—a single hair. The first night on the road with the convoy would be the perfect time to use it. While the camp sleeps, Themis or another magus could perform a scrying ritual. What do they see? Is the friar meeting with someone suspicious? Is he performing a dark ritual of his own? Or do they merely see a tired man praying, deepening the mystery of his true nature?
    
- **Sir Kylan's Secret Mission:** Sir Kylan spoke of heretics in Provence and a "possible crusade." This is not idle talk. As they travel, he may test the piety of his companions. He might pointedly ask "Sir Paulemille" to lead a prayer or question Spatha on his devotion. Any hesitation or misstep could raise his suspicions. His primary mission may be to protect Margaret, but his secondary one could be to root out heresy, placing the magi in constant, subtle danger.
    
- **The Boy Who Saw Magic:** The child who watched the group's magical preparations is a loose end. He could reappear before they depart. Perhaps he runs up to Drusilla, asking how she made her wine, or points at Spatha and tells a guard, "That man's armor wasn't there a moment ago!" This could create a minor but stressful incident, forcing the magi to use wit and mundane persuasion to dismiss a child's fanciful tale without revealing themselves.
    

### III. The First League of the Journey

The eight-day journey to Lyon begins. The first day sets the tone for the entire mission.

- **The Royal Procession:** Traveling with Margaret is entirely different from their journey to Forcalquier. The pace will be slower, dictated by the princess's comfort. There will be more outriders, more servants, and more formality. How do the magi adapt to this new dynamic? Do they ride alongside Sir Kylan, or are they relegated to the perimeter with the other guards?
    
- **An Early Test:** Introduce a non-magical, or subtly magical, challenge on the first day. This is a chance for the magi to prove their worth to Sir Kylan.
    
    - **A "Bad Omen":** A flock of crows descends on the path, spooking the horses. While the guards struggle to calm them, Luc (in animal form) could discern the true cause.
        
    - **A Blocked Bridge:** A key bridge is "out," forcing a detour through a less secure region. Is it simple misfortune, or sabotage? Spatha's astrological insights or Themis's magical senses might reveal the truth.
        
    - This first test should be an opportunity for the magi to provide a solution that Sir Kylan's soldiers cannot, earning them a measure of trust from the wary knight.
        

The path is laid, Storyguide. The characters have navigated the prelude and now stand at the beginning of the great task. Let them now face the challenge of protecting a princess while hiding their true nature from their closest ally.
