Hark, Storyguide, let us delve into the currents of fate and prepare for the gathering of the magi at Miniata Sophia. The postponement due to drought is an ill omen, perhaps, but also an opportunity for reflection and, paradoxically, for new growth amidst scarcity. Hosting the Tribunal falls upon the Criamon, a House often dwelling in contemplation rather than worldly affairs, ensuring this gathering will be unlike those held in the grand halls of Castra Solis or the bustling markets near Coenobium.

**Setting the Stage: Miniata Sophia in 1236**

- **Atmosphere:** Envision the Tribunal convened not in opulent chambers, but perhaps within the Niaux cave system itself, galleries lit by enchanted lights or simple torches, the air cool and echoing. Lodgings might be austere, simple cells carved from rock or tents erected outside the cave mouth. Feasts may be replaced by communal, simple meals, perhaps vegetarian, fostering introspection rather than revelry. The Criamon focus will be less on procedure and politics, more on the _meaning_ behind the gathering, the "apt action" for the Tribunal. Leonarda , Benoit's parens, might guide proceedings with quiet wisdom, while Tumbarius could lead philosophical debates. This is neutral ground, yes, but steeped in Criamon mystery.
    
- **The Drought & Herbam Vis:** The call for Herbam vis sets a tone of shared crisis. How is this vis collected? Is it a simple donation, or is there a ritualistic presentation? Does the scarcity fuel debate about resource management or magical solutions to mundane problems? Perhaps some magi express frustration that the Order must divert resources to such matters, while others see it as a moral imperative. This theme of scarcity and responsibility can permeate discussions.
    

**Continuing Mysteries & Intrigues**

1. **The Shadow of Dama and Maju:**
    
    - **Dama's Position:** She remains Praeco , but her influence might be subtly questioned after Ophilio's death and Tibaut's disappearance/capture. Her cult, the Matres & Matrones, continues to operate. Drusilla has now been initiated and received the Gentle Gift.
        
    - **Roleplaying Opportunities:**
        
        - _Cult Politics:_ Dama may convene her cult members (Beatrice , Azaleis , potentially Drusilla , Marcella , Mariola ) for secret meetings during the Tribunal. Drusilla's new Gentle Gift might alter her interactions and perceptions within the cult and the wider Tribunal. How does Azaleis's jealousy manifest? Does Mariola's disappointment lead her to oppose Dama?
        - _Ophilio's Demise:_ Apollo, armed with knowledge from Ophilio's lab notes about Dama's rituals and Maju's peculiarity , might seek allies (Pila , Protendus ) to challenge Solis's superficial investigation or subtly probe Dama's involvement. The unusual circumstances (Final Twilight during a ritual ) demand scrutiny.
        - _Tibaut's Fate:_ Though Penelope learned Tibaut was captured by Oriande , Dama's narrative about his visit might still be questioned. Beatrice , Tibaut's daughter and Quaesitor, remains a key figure. Will she press for more answers, or has Dama successfully neutralized her suspicions? Her hostility towards Merinita could surface. Penelope shared suspicions with Jeane , and Spatha also distrusts Dama.
        - _Maju's Influence:_ Look for subtle signs. Odd behavior from Dama? Animals reacting strangely around her? Perhaps Maju attempts to influence a vulnerable NPC or even a player character.
            
2. **The Sundered Covenant: Tolosa Paratge:**
    
    - **Status:** The covenant remains fractured between the White (anti-Cathar) and Black (pro-Cathar) factions. Carolus St. Tropez and Cyprian lead the opposing sides. Mariola, the nominal leader, is ineffective. The conflict stems from deep ideological divides exacerbated by the Crusade.
        
    - **Roleplaying Opportunities:**
        
        - _Formal Complaint:_ Will either faction bring the matter before the Tribunal formally, seeking intervention or sanction against the other? This could lead to intense debates about Hermetic law, mundane interference, and religious tolerance within the Order.
        - _Lobbying for Support:_ Representatives from both factions (perhaps Carolus, Cyprian, or others like Adam Carpentiere or Raimond ) will surely be present, attempting to garner votes and allies. They might offer vis, information, or future political support in exchange for backing.
        - _Mediation Attempt:_ Could neutral parties (perhaps the Criamon hosts, or even player characters) attempt to mediate? This would involve navigating complex grievances and potentially dangerous personalities. Benoit, with his Criamon ties , might be approached by Raimond, the Gorgiastic Cathar member.
        - _Quaesitorial Involvement:_ Beatrice, as Chief Quaesitor, may be forced to act if the situation escalates or if a formal complaint is lodged. This tests her authority and political acumen.
            
3. **The Fires of Crusade:**
    
    - **Status:** The Albigensian Crusade continues to cast a long shadow. The political landscape remains volatile . The presence of Esther, a Cathar Perfecta, at Mons Clara is a potential complication. The last Tribunal narrowly voted against direct intervention.
        
    - **Roleplaying Opportunities:**
        
        - _Renewed Debate:_ Has the situation worsened enough for Castra Solis (Garus ) or Ostal des Exiles (Gilbert ) to again demand Hermetic action? How have alliances shifted? The drought might be blamed by some on divine displeasure due to inaction against heretics, or conversely, on the violence of the Crusade itself.
        - _Refugees & Reports:_ Have more magi been displaced? Are there reports of mundane interference impacting vis sources or covenant security? News of Rixenda's concerns about Margaret's journey highlights the ongoing instability.
        - _The Esther Question:_ Could knowledge of Esther's presence at Mons Clara leak? This could place the covenant in a difficult political position, especially with pro-Crusade factions.
        - _Philosophical Division:_ The Criamon hosts might facilitate discussions on the nature of faith, heresy, and the Order's role, reflecting the deep divisions present.
            

**New Seeds of Intrigue**

1. **The Criamon Enigma:** Miniata Sophia itself is a mystery. Perhaps the Criamon present attendees with a philosophical puzzle or paradox related to the drought or the state of the Tribunal, observing their responses. Maybe an ancient prophecy linked to the caves surfaces during the gathering. Could Benoit's connection lead him (and the party) into a deeper Criamon plot or initiation inadvertently?
2. **The Magical Drought:** Could the drought be more than mundane? Perhaps linked to the Gorgon under Mons Clara , the disturbance of faerie realms , or the actions of a powerful weather mage (like Calais ) or spirit (like Ventoux )? This could be a background investigation threading through the Tribunal.
3. **Resource Rivalries:** The Nascente do Verdon dispute between Mons Clara and Coenobium might resurface. Are other vis sources contested due to the drought or shifting populations?
4. **Hedge Wizard Diplomacy:** With Dama's Sorginak and Coenobium's network, perhaps a motion is brought regarding the Order's official stance or relationship with hedge traditions in Provence. Lavandarius might present a case, potentially opposed by more traditionalist magi. Drusilla's recent initiation and potential contact with Sorginak could place her in a unique position.
5. **Rising Stars & Old Ghosts:** Introduce a charismatic young magus challenging established figures. Or perhaps an artifact or text related to Val Negra or another fallen covenant like Barbegal (which Spatha has investigated and received a mandate for ) appears, stirring old rivalries between Aedes Mercurii and Castra Solis.

**Structuring the Tribunal Session**

- **Arrival & Atmosphere:** Describe the unique cave setting, the Criamon's potentially detached or overly philosophical hosting style. The collection of Herbam vis could be a significant initial event.
- **Opening Council:** Formalities, Beatrice's confirmation, agenda setting. Dama's role as Praeco.
- **Key Debates:** Dedicate time for the Tolosa Paratge issue, the Crusade question, and perhaps a new significant motion (hedge wizards, drought response).
- **Side Meetings & Intrigue:** Encourage players to use the breaks and evenings for investigation (Apollo), politicking (Themis, potentially Spatha), cult activities (Drusilla), or philosophical discussion (Benoit, Spatha). Use the unique setting for secret meetings in dark cave corners.
- **The Unexpected:** Introduce a surprise event – a prophecy, a challenge, the arrival of an unexpected guest (Tres? ), or a magical phenomenon related to the cave/drought.
- **Voting & Resolutions:** Bring key issues to a vote. Remember Miniata Sophia's tendency to vote morally, which might unpredictably swing results. Record outcomes and political shifts.
- **Closing & Departure:** Formal closing, setting the date/location for the next Tribunal, players making travel plans and reflecting on events.

Remember, Storyguide, the Tribunal is a crucible. Old tensions boil, new alliances are forged in whispers, and the actions taken (or not taken) will shape the future of Provence. Use the strange neutrality of the Criamon hosts to highlight the passions and conflicts of their guests. Let the echoes in the caves mirror the echoes of history and ambition within the hearts of the magi. Good fortune with your preparations!

### Minor Tribunal Disputes for Voting

1. **The Case of the Poached Apprentice:** Magus Constantine of **Bellaquin** formally accuses Magus Arnauld of **Aedes Mercurii** of unlawfully luring away his most promising apprentice. Jausbert claims Arnauld used offers of access to Aedes Mercurii's vast library and resources to break the apprenticeship bond, a charge Arnauld denies, stating the apprentice came to him freely, fleeing Jausbert's "archaic and stifling" tutelage. This requires testimonies and digs at the pride and prestige of both covenants.

Mons Clara: Votam com Belaquin.
Aedes Mercurii: Arnauld tem que pagar uma multa.

2. **The Over-Harvested River:** Renaud of **Stella Durus**, a covenant suffering from the drought, petitions the Tribunal to censure **Coenobium** for the "irresponsible and excessive" harvesting of an Aquam vis source on a river feeding their territory. Protendus of Coenobium dismisses the claim, stating their harvesting is within ancient rights and that Stella Durus is merely seeking a scapegoat for its own poor resource management. This directly plays into the drought crisis and pits a desperate covenant against a powerful, wealthy one.

Mons Clara: votam contra Ceonobium
Cenobium é censurado. Precisa moderar a coleta de vis.

3. **Redcap Compensation for Lost Goods:** Magus Gilbert of **Ostal des Exiles** files a motion demanding compensation (in vis) from the local Mercere representatives (based at Aedes Mercurii) for a critical shipment of laboratory supplies lost by a Redcap caravan. The Mercere defense is that the caravan was destroyed by "extraordinary mundane conflict" (a Crusader patrol) and thus falls under _force majeure_. This debate questions Redcap responsibility versus the realities of the Crusade. Player character **Apollo** may be called upon to speak for his House.

Mons Clara: não votam contra os Mercere.
  
4. **Sanctuary for a Magical Beast:** Giraud, a Bjornaer from Tolosa Paragne , petitions the Tribunal to legally recognize his "tamed" magical beast (perhaps a peculiar, fire-resistant salamander from the drought-stricken lands) as part of his sanctum, granting it full protection under the Code. He claims it is essential for his research. This motion raises concerns about safety, the definition of a sanctum, and the eccentricities of House Bjornaer, likely drawing comment from player character **Luc**.

Mons Clara: votam contra Bjornaer

5. **Motion to Censure "Alarmist" Divinations:** A magus from **Castra Solis**, acting on behalf of Primus Garus, proposes a motion to formally censure any magus who performs "broad or alarmist" divinations concerning the Crusade's outcome or the drought's future. The motion claims such divinations incite panic, disrupt mundane order, and risk attracting the unwanted attention of the Church. This is a political move to silence critics or doom-sayers.

Mons Clara: A ajuda de Mons Clara lrva a moção à falhar. 

6. **A Criamon Procedural Query:** The host, Tumbarius of **Miniata Sophia**, proposes a motion not for action, but for "collective contemplation." He moves that the Tribunal must vote on whether the _postponement_ of the Tribunal itself was an "apt" response to the drought, or a "failure" of Hermetic will. The vote is meaningless in practice, but forces every magus to make a philosophical declaration, much to the annoyance of the more practical-minded attendees like the Flambeau.

Mons Clara: --

7. **The Disputed Library:** Two magi, **Azaleis of Ceonobium** and **Marcella of Stella Durus** (both members of Dama's cult), bring forth competing claims for the library of a recently deceased magus. Azaleis claims the magus was a secret mentor and promised her his books. Marcella presents a contract showing the magus owed her covenant a significant debt, with his library as collateral. This personal dispute between two of Dama's followers could expose fractures in her alliance.

Mons Clara: Contra o Cenobium, mas Azalais recebe os livros (e a dívida)

Tres: multa para Castra Solis e Aedes Mercurii.
Quem votou a favor de Tres? 20 votos!

8. **Standardizing Hospitality Rites:** Citing the "unusual" (some say "lacking") hospitality of their Criamon hosts, a Jerbiton magus (Damocles) from **Coenobium** proposes a motion to standardize the minimum requirements of hospitality for a Tribunal host, including specific quantities of food, wine, and lodging quality. This is a direct, public insult to Miniata Sophia, wrapped in a veneer of civilized procedure.

Mons Clara: votam contra os Jerbiton, não passam. Não tem requisitos mínimos.

Próximo Tribunal: em 1241 em Aedes Mercurii.
