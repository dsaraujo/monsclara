After being dominated by Maju, [Dama ex Merinita](Dama%20ex%20Merinita.md) killed Tibaut, 

Senex thought that the Mystery Cults were behind the secret Infernal Cult that secretly plagues the Provence, before actually finding out about Dama. Tibaut followed his footsteps, and that is why he requested members from all of the Mystery Houses of the Provance.

Tibaut actually challenged [Luc ex Merinita](Luc%20ex%20Merinita.md) to a certamen over some questioning of the Merinita (which later led to [Beatrice ex Guernicus](Beatrice%20ex%20Guernicus.md) hold a grudge against the Tribunal's Merinita)

Dama explains about [Allande](Allande.md) and the [The Fairy Regios](The%20Fairy%20Regios.md). [Oriande la Fée](Oriande%20la%20Fée.md) . 

Explains that need a new balance.
