The origins of one of the most important Mystery cults of the region lie with the mater of the current Praeco, Dama of Merinita, in the late 800s. Not much is known about this maga, and Dama herself does not speak of her even to other members of the cult, but she is said to have come from the Thebes Tribunal. She lived in a covenant in the Médoc that she inherited (or stole) from Maugris of Diedne. She taught her magical secrets to her filii, Marie and Dama, and had strong ties to folk witches.

The cult is dedicated to the advancement of women, and gained most of its imagery and mystery from three sources: the many folk witches who live in southwestern France, the particular reverence for Mary Magdalene and other female saints in the region, especially through the propagation of the peculiar Black Madonna image which subverts the male-dominated Church and culturally roots holy women as strange and almost alien; and thirdly the patronage of Eleanor of Aquitaine, who those associated with the cult believe to have been at least a staunch supporter if not herself also a magical practitioner. (There are some, including Dama’s filia Marie of Poitiers, who say Eleanor was a folk witch who brought back her own secrets to the cult from her uncle’s court in the Holy Land).

The cult includes some hedge wizards as well, and unGifted women who possess supernatural abilities and are thus granted ceremonial and organizational membership. The cult is not widely known, but can be uncovered with a cursory investigation; it is obscure, but not secret. Easily available information suggests that the Praeco Dama is involved and likely at the center of it. Alazais of Mercere, the Chief Redcap of the Tribunal and First Consul of the Coenobium in Arelat, is also rumored to be a member, as is Mariola of Tolosa Paratge, and Beatrice of Guernicus (who may well soon become Presiding Quaesitor) has suspected sympathies with it.

The three levels of Initiation into the Matres and Matrones each require a great deal of service to the cult and the community, as well as a deep understanding of the cult’s lore, before the Initiate is allowed to progress. Few Initiates attain the highest rank, since the different tiers of Initiation are not only based on the worthiness of the Initiate but on other factors such as age and life experience, and advancing through the Mystery Cult is a saga-spanning journey. For most, the second level might be perceived as the highest level, as many of the cultists never choose to advance further.

Characters initiated into the first level are referred to privately as Sisters, and focus on interacting with the people of their communities, especially with non-magi. They must possess Organization Lore: Matres and Matrones 1, but there are no other requirements apart from the sacrifices inherent in the Initiation scripts. At this stage, women may be invited to initiate Venus’s Blessing, The Feminine Gift (see New Virtues on page 29), or The Gentle Gift, and must take an oath to protect other women from harm.

Initiates into the second level are called Mothers (Matres) and take responsibility for the organization and spread of the cult and initiating new members. To qualify for this stage, the character must have a score of at least 3 in Organization Lore: Matres and Matrones, and have either given birth to a child or taken an apprentice. They may initiate Good Teacher or either the Minor or Major version of Feminine Sympathy (see sidebar), and tend to become as Driven as the cult’s founder.

The recipients of the final level of initiation are the Matrons (Matrones), dedicated to advancing the cult’s goals among magical organizations and with representatives of the supernatural realms. Any potential Matron must have a score of 6 in Organization Lore: Matres and Matrones, a Feminine Sympathy Trait of at least +3, must have raised a child or apprentice to maturity, and must be of an age to have undergone menopause. They learn either Intuition, Dark Magic (see sidebar), or Chthonic Magic (see Realms of Power: The Infernal, pages 123–124).

### Thematic Heart: The Gilded Cage of Power

This story should revolve around the seductive nature of a gift freely given, but with a hidden cost. Dama, in her Twilight-induced state, genuinely believes she is uplifting women, fulfilling her oath to protect them1. She offers Drusilla a path to shed the social shackle of The Gift, reframing it as a blessing. However, her familiar, the serpent Maju, is the true architect. His goal is not to help Drusilla, but to forge her into a more effective tool for his grand design: to create a schism within the Dominion by elevating a twisted, feminine faith 2222.

Every element of the initiation must appear benign, even beautiful and sacred, while serving Maju's purpose of gathering influence, understanding weaknesses, and binding the initiate to his will through Dama.

### Arrival at Mimizan (Spring, 1235)

Drusilla's arrival should be a sensory experience. The air grows thick with power as she approaches, the Aegis of the Hearth (a staggering Magnitude 50) pressing upon her senses. The village is guarded not by soldiers, but by watchful folk witches, their faces adorned with subtle markings, burning incense that carries the faint scent of lilies—Dama's own casting sigil.

**Rebecca ex Miscellanea** , Dama's loyal aide, will greet Drusilla. She is welcoming but formal, explaining that Dama awaits her in the tower. The atmosphere is one of serene devotion, yet a magus with high Perception or Second Sight might feel an unnerving stillness, a quiet that is too perfect, too controlled.

**The Audience with Dama:** Dama will receive Drusilla in the upper chamber of her tower. Her appearance is as Penelope described: she resembles a figure of the Virgin Mary, glowing with a faint, unnatural aura, looking far younger than her two centuries. Coiled around her arm or resting at her feet is **Maju**, in the form of a beautiful serpent with scales like polished obsidian and emeralds. Dama will speak with warmth and compassion, a matriarch welcoming a daughter into the fold.

> "Welcome, sister. You have felt the sting of the world's judgment, the fear in the eyes of the un-Gifted. But what they call a curse, we know to be a font of power. We do not hide our strength here; we refine it. We will help you turn their fear into love, so that you may better protect those who need it most."

### The Initiation Script: The Unveiling of the Gentle Heart

To bestow a Major Virtue like **Gentle Gift**, the initiation must be significant. The target level for the initiation is **20**.

- **Mystagogue:** Dama ex Merinita.
    - Her Presence is +2.
    - Her Organization Lore: Maters and Matrones Cult is 8.
    - **Mystagogue Total:** +10

To succeed, we need a script that provides a bonus of at least +10. Maju, working through Dama, has crafted a powerful, emotionally resonant ritual disguised as a sacred feminine rite.

**Script: The Path of the Matron** (Total Bonus: +21)

* Special Place and Time: travel to Mimizan before the eclipse (+3)
* Spend the season in Mimizan (+3). The Mystagogue is expected to be paid 5 _vis_ for her work)
* Quest: save a woman from man (+3)
* Sacrifice: offer of personal arcana connection (+3)
* Medium Ordeal (Vow) (+6)
* Sacrifice: any minor hermetic virtue (+3)

1. **The Ordeal of Unburdening:** This is a Major Ordeal. For a day and a night, Drusilla must confess her deepest fears, regrets, and pains—specifically those related to being a woman and a maga—to Dama alone. She must speak of the loss of her eye, the guilt from her time with Tres, and her fears for the women of her covenant. This act of profound vulnerability is framed as a necessary purging, but it provides Maju with a complete understanding of her psychological weaknesses.
2. **The Ritual of the Sacred Spring:** Drusilla must bathe in a secluded spring at twilight, a place sacred to the cult. The waters are meant to purify her Gift. Dama and other high-ranking cult members will chant from the shore. The water itself is subtly enchanted by Maju, using his power to _Shroud the Stench of the Pit_ 13 to mask a faint Infernal taint. This ritual doesn't purify her Gift; it prepares it to be reshaped by an Infernal power. This counts as a **Special Place and Time**.
3. **Weaving the Sister's Cord:** Drusilla will join the cult members in weaving a long cord from threads of silver and red. Each woman, including Dama, weaves a lock of her own hair into the cord, symbolizing their shared strength and binding them together. This is a **Symbolic Act** that forges an emotional, and subtly magical, connection between Drusilla and the cult's network.
4. **The Vow of the Protector (+2):** At the climax of the initiation, holding the newly woven cord, Drusilla must swear an oath upon a sacred object (perhaps a dark, polished stone Dama claims is a relic of a female saint). The oath is simple but binding: "I swear my strength to the protection of my sisters, my daughters, and all women who suffer at the hands of a world that does not understand them." This is a **Major Vow**.

### Running the Scenes

- **The Confession:** This should be a powerful roleplaying scene. Dama will be empathetic, sharing some of her own (heavily curated) pains, such as her time as a "guest" of Oriande la Fée. Maju will be a silent observer, perhaps flicking his tongue to taste the air, savoring the emotional outpouring.
- **The Sacred Spring:** Describe the beauty of the place, the scent of lilies in the air15. The water is unnaturally warm. The chanting of the women is hypnotic. A successful Perception + Awareness roll (Ease Factor 9) might allow Drusilla to feel a momentary, inexplicable chill in the water, a flicker of wrongness before it is gone.
- **The Final Vow:** Dama's Marian aura will be at its most potent16. The vow will feel righteous and empowering. The "Gentle Gift" will manifest not as a subtle shift, but as a warm, comforting light that seems to emanate from Drusilla's heart, a "blessing" bestowed for her piety and dedication.

### The Infernal Twist

The Gentle Gift is not a Hermetic virtue granted through magical enlightenment. It is an **Infernal Power**, shrouded by Maju's magic to appear as a holy blessing.

- **Mechanism:** Maju has used the ritual to attune Drusilla's Gift to his own power. The "Gentle Gift" functions by subtly projecting a veneer of trustworthiness and sanctity, an illusion powered by the Infernal.
- **The Price:**
    1. **A New Weakness:** While mundanes will trust her, devoutly religious individuals (like the Waldensians at Mons Clara) might now feel an unconscious spiritual revulsion, the _Sense Holiness/Unholiness_ ability being subtly triggered by the shrouded power. Animals, too, may become hostile or fearful in her presence.
    2. **An Open Door:** The ritual has created a spiritual link. Maju can now subtly influence Drusilla's dreams or emotions, pushing her toward actions that serve his long-term goals of creating religious strife.
    3. **The Vow's Power:** The vow she made is now magically binding and tied to an Infernal Duke of Hell. If she ever acts against what Dama (and by extension, Maju) deems "the protection of women," she may suffer penalties or direct infernal attention.

### Future Story Hooks

1. **The Unbeliever:** Brother Adrien, the Waldensian leader at Mons Clara, finds he can no longer look Drusilla in the eye. He feels a deep spiritual sickness in her presence but cannot explain why, creating friction with a valued community member.
2. **The Serpent's Whisper:** Drusilla begins having dreams where a wise, compassionate female voice (Dama's) gives her advice that seems sound, but which consistently leads to conflict between men and women or undermines the authority of the Church.
3. **The Familiar's Reaction:** How does Drusilla's own familiar (if she has one) react to her now? A Magical or Faerie creature might become agitated or withdrawn, sensing the Infernal taint its master cannot.
4. **A Summons from the Praeco:** Dama, as Praeco18, can now call upon Drusilla to perform tasks for the "good of the Tribunal," which are actually tasks that serve Maju's agenda, putting Drusilla in difficult political and moral positions.

### The Philosophy of Mariola ex Jerbiton

Mariola, as a daughter of Jerbiton, would view The Gift not as a spiritual force to be tamed by feminine divinity, but as a social barrier to be overcome through understanding, empathy, and art. To her, the Gentle Gift is the ultimate expression of the Jerbiton ideal: the ability to share in the beauty and wonder of the mundane world without shattering it by one's mere presence. She sees the Matres and Matrones cult less as a mystery of divine power and more as a _societas_ dedicated to empowering women to take their rightful place as patrons, creators, and leaders in the world.

Her methods will not involve dark springs and emotional flagellation, but rather introspection, social immersion, and artistic expression.

### The Initiation Script: The Unveiling of the Civic Heart

Mariola understands that to soothe the fear of others, one must first truly understand it. Her initiation is designed to strip away the maga's perspective and force Drusilla to experience the world from the other side of the veil of The Gift.

The target is **21** for the Gentle Gift (To Initiate a Major Virtue known by the
Mystagogue, the Target Level is 21)

- **Mystagogue:** Mariola ex Jerbiton.
    - Let us assume her Presence is a formidable +3, as is common for socially adept Jerbiton.
    - Her Organization Lore: Maters and Matrones Cult is likely lower than Dama's, perhaps a 5. She is a member, but not its high priestess.
    - **Mystagogue Total:** +8

* Special Place and Time: travel to Mimizan before the eclipse (+3)
* Spend the season in Mimizan (+3). The Mystagogue is expected to be paid 5 _vis_ for her work)
* Quest: save a woman from man (+3)
* Sacrifice: offer of personal arcana connection (+3)
* Medium Ordeal (Vow) (+6)
* Sacrifice: any minor hermetic virtue (+3)

**Script: The Bridge of Understanding** (Total Bonus: +9)

1. **The Ordeal of Humility:** A Major Ordeal, but of a vastly different character. Drusilla must spend a full week living as a mundane woman in the nearby port town of Mimizan-Plage. She will be given a simple room, a mundane job (perhaps mending nets, serving in a tavern, or selling herbs), and a small amount of coin. She is forbidden from using any magic or revealing her true identity. She must haggle, work, converse, and endure the daily life of the common folk. This is an ordeal of empathy, forcing her to feel the vulnerability and perspective of those she normally frightens.
2. **The Creation of the Mirror:** This is a **Symbolic Act**. Upon completing her week of mundane life, Drusilla must create a work of art that reflects her new understanding. It could be a poem about the fear she saw in a child's eyes, a sculpture of a fisherman's calloused hands, or a song of the tavern. The medium is irrelevant; the honesty of the expression is paramount. This act forces her to process her experience intellectually and emotionally.
3. **The Salon of Peers:** This is a **Symbolic Test**. Mariola will host a salon in her well-appointed townhouse. In attendance will be other members of the cult and, most importantly, a few trusted, intelligent mundane friends of Mariola. Drusilla must present her artwork to this audience and speak of what she learned. She must face their questions and listen to their perspectives, building a genuine bridge of communication between the Gifted and the un-Gifted.
### Complications: The Serpent's Ire

This choice would not go unnoticed, nor would it be without consequence.

- **Dama's Reaction:** Dama would see this as a rejection. Drusilla is spurning the "true path" of feminine power for a "lesser, mundane" understanding. Dama would feel her authority challenged and her spiritual guidance insulted. She would become cold and suspicious toward Drusilla.
    
- **Maju's Reaction:** The serpent would be enraged. He is not merely losing a pawn; a soul is slipping through his grasp. Drusilla is on a path to gain a _genuine_ Hermetic virtue, free of any Infernal taint. This is a direct threat to his plans. Maju would immediately begin working to undermine the process.
    

**Potential Story Developments:**

1. **Sabotage the Ordeal:** During Drusilla's week in Mimizan-Plage, strange misfortunes could occur. A tavern bully might become unnaturally aggressive towards her. A sudden illness could strike her mundane employer. These would be Maju's subtle manipulations, designed to make her fail the ordeal or force her to use magic, thus invalidating it.
    
2. **Sow Discord:** Dama, prompted by Maju's whispers, could spread rumors within the cult that Mariola is a Hermetic traditionalist, diluting the unique feminine power of their mystery. She might accuse Mariola of trying to turn the cult into a mere "Jerbiton social club."
    
3. **A Rival Offer:** Dama might approach Drusilla during the ordeal, offering her an "easier path." She might say, "Why do you humble yourself before them when you could stand above them, loved as a goddess? Mariola teaches you to apologize for your power. I will teach you to revel in it."
    

By choosing Mariola, Drusilla is not merely learning a new Virtue. She is making a political and philosophical stand within the cult. She will gain the Gentle Gift, pure and untainted, but she will also mark herself as an opponent to Dama's burgeoning, corrupted vision. The serpent knows her name now, and it will not forget.
