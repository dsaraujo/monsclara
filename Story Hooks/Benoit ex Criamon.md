Mistaken Identity

Leonarda ex Criamon

Leonarda explica que Benoit, nas palavras do fundador Criamon:

>"You are already immortal. Time forms a great Circle. Every life is repeated, identical in every breath, each cycle of time."

>*Iam immortalis es. Tempus magnum circulum format. Omnis vita repetitur, in omni spiritu idem, in quoque circulo temporis.*

## Mistaken Identity Ideas

- During travels, old portraits, statues, of text descriptions show the image of Benoit
- Magical or Fairy creatures recognize him as the great old magi. Or old enimies.
- Dopplegangers might also spread the identity around
- A small bandit has a reward for its head. It is Benoit.
## Letter

To Benoit ex Criamon,

It is with no small amount of consternation that I, Augustus ex Tytalus, Archmagi of Greenwalde, address this missive to you. For generations, a fragile truce has held sway between the noble houses of Tytalus and Criamon, a truce brokered by the esteemed Rhine Tribunal itself in the wake of the... unpleasantness... surrounding the Font of Asterion.

Imagine my outrage, then, to discover what appears to be a Criamon stirring trouble in the very heart of that ancient wellspring of magic! Reports from my forest wardens detail sightings of a young magi meddling with the Font's energies. While your House is no stranger to the arcane arts, surely you wouldn't stoop so low as to encroach upon territory designated as neutral ground by the Tribunal itself?

However, a nagging suspicion gnaws at me. The reports describe the magi's garb and mannerisms – a touch too... old-fashioned, shall we say? It stirs a memory, faint but persistent, of a bygone era. Could it be that you've enlisted some callow apprentice to do your dirty work?

No, a far more unsettling possibility presents itself. Nicolau ex Jerbiton, that rogue scholar who vanished from the Rhine Tribunal in the 9th century – whispers reached even our remote corner of Germania about his unorthodox Corpus Magic theories and subsequent expulsion. Could it be that this "magus" is, in fact, the long-lost Nicolau himself, masquerading as a youthful adept to avoid detection?

Think carefully, Benoit ex Criamon. If you are indeed harboring this fugitive – or worse, encouraging his meddling with the Font of Asterion – you tread a perilous path. The Rhine Tribunal may have a long memory, but the forests of East Germania have one far older. Do not tempt me to unleash forces that even the combined might of our Houses might struggle to contain.

Let us settle this matter with civility, as befits our station. A meeting at the neutral ground designated by the Tribunal seems prudent. There, we can discuss this situation rationally and avoid a resurgence of the ancient conflict neither of us desires.

I eagerly await your reply.

With cautious regards,

Augustus ex Tytalus,
Count of the Greenwalde

## Investigating Nicolau's Lab

Learning that are possible:

### Int+Magic Theory

- **6**: Notes on the need of a strong magic aura, and how to imbue that magic into things/bodies
- **9**: Sometimes the name Caesar is mentioned, without clarity on who is this person
- **12**: You find a painting with your face on it. The picture dates of 960 (before Nicolau was "born")
- **15**: Notes on soul transfer and references to Diedne magic. Likely to be a problem to a Quaesitor investigation.

There is another "secret" wall inside the lab. Inside there is only one thing: a map with the region of Mons Clara, but focusing on the Alps. Only three locations marked: Mons Clara, Harco (domus magma), and a new location in the middle of the Alps.
