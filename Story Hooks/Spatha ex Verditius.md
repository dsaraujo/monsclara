## Cena Inicial

Gauntlet de Spatha. No estúdio de Ruberus, ele espera Spatha mostrar sua obra prima, e dá a Spatha seu voting sigil, o direito de participar do concurso em Verdi, e se dispões a ensinar Verdidius Cult Lore quando Spatha estiver pronto.

Ele recomenda Spatha ir visitar o outro Verditius do tribunal: Adam Carpentiere, em Tolosa Paratge. E, claro, se tiver interesse, outros Sodales na Normandia ou tribunal de Roma. Adam está velho, e Ruberus espera ter mais um aprendiz depois de alguns anos, mas espera que Spatha possa continuar a tradição não muito numerosa na Provença.

Ele entrega um livro de Rego, escrito por Faventinus ex Verditius: In Invisibili Manu. Apesar da tradução do Italiano, o livro está completamente iluminado e ressonado com jóias que pertenceram à coroas reais.

Ruberus explica o motivo de enviá-lo para Mons Clara: descobrir mais sobre Sellen ex Verditius, os metais do céu, e as misteriosas cavernas internas. Ele explica que Aedes Mercurii não irá nem ajudar nem ir contra Mons Clara Nova, mas que vai depender se eles se aliarem politicamente a Castra Solis ou não.

Ele também divide que está querendo fazer um presente para Dama, a Praeco.

No caminho para o covenant, Spatha vê chuvas de meteoros. Ele é o primeiro a encontrar Sera, a mercere.

## Cartas com Tibaut

Sodales Spatha ex Verditius,

My recent interactions have been regrettably brief, a limitation born of my burdensome condition. Fortes fortuna adiuvat [fortune favors the bold] and your efforts, along with your fellow magi at Mons Clara, give me hope that this covenant's fortunes may yet be turned.

The integrity of Julius sancta was indeed a testament to his craft, though as you have witnessed, not without its perils. I am relieved to learn of both your well-being and that of Penelope.

Your caution regarding further exploration of the mountain is well-heeded. While its dangers are more of the mundane sort, they are no less perilous. Ars longa, vita brevis. [art is long, life is short].

Your celestial aspirations are a welcome light in these challenging times. While my own knowledge of the stars is limited, I recall the name of Rogier ex Verditius, a Roman magus renowned for his star charts. Alas, the fall of Barbegal scattered him and many others. Perhaps the Jerbiton at Coenobium know his fate. Should your search lead you in his direction, share this: some years ago, I identified what may be the remnants of Barbegal while seeking signs of Fraxinetum's influence. I have included directions with my hopes it may further your cause. It lies twenty leagues northwest, towards Embrun and near the village of Barles.

May your path be guided by wisdom and fortune.

With enduring respect,

Tibaut fili Gernicus

Aprilis, the 12th day of year 1220 of our Lord

**  
The Roman Watermill Complex of Barbegal:** Marcella, a Bonisagus maga from Stella Durus, is searching for ways to identify and harness the powers of magical spirits. One avenue of research is attempting to recover the Roman watermill complex of Barbegal, which could bring her into conflict with the Coenobium's political aims**3**. The magi of Mons Clara could get involved by offering to help Marcella with her research, either in exchange for her knowledge or to prevent the Coenobium from gaining an advantage.

Travelling to [Aedes Mercurii](Aedes%20Mercurii.md):

**The Rival's Handiwork:** In a small, prosperous town near Aix, the talk is all about a new public well, one that draws water on its own with a clever system of counterweights and what locals call "ingenious clockwork." Upon inspection, Spatha recognizes the distinctive style and magical sigil of another Verditius, Venarius, from Castra Solis (his sigil is metal veins). The device is impressive, but flawed in a subtle way only he might notice—a flaw that could cause it to fail spectacularly in a few months. Does he warn the townsfolk, risking exposure? Does he try to subtly fix it, proving his own superiority? Or does he leave it, knowing his rival's reputation will eventually suffer?

**The Broken Wonder:** The party seeks shelter in a small, isolated monastery near *Lorgues*. The monks are troubled because their prized church bell, said to have been blessed by a saint to ward off evil spirits and hailstorms, has cracked. They have heard of Spatha's reputation as a mender of things and beg him for his aid. The bell is suffused with a weak but genuine divine aura (as described in _Faith and Flame_, the power of faith is strong in Provence). Repairing it would be a significant mundane challenge (requiring Craft skills), but doing so might earn him a powerful blessing, a useful ally, or draw unwanted attention from a local demon who enjoyed the bell's silence.

**The Ancient Roman Road:** Part of their journey takes them along an old, remarkably well-preserved Roman road. One evening, as dusk settles, the air grows cold. A ghostly procession of Roman legionaries, their spectral armor clinking softly, marches past them. They are an echo of the past, harmless unless interfered with. However, one of the ghostly centurions might stop, look directly at Spatha (or a companion), and offer a cryptic warning or prophecy in Latin related to his journey, perhaps mistaking him for a priest of Mercury/Hermes. This could be a powerful omen for his initiation.

O fantasma não parece falar com Spatha, mas para as próprias estrelas. A sua voz é como o som de pedra rangendo contra pedra:

> "O _caelum_ gira, e as esferas dentro das esferas cantam uma canção de criação que ensurdece os mortais. Tu desejas aprender a melodia."
> 
> "Para entender o todo, deves primeiro capturar uma única nota. Cria um mundo. Molda um errante do céu noturno, não com a _Ars_ que é o teu poder, mas com o labor que é a tua condição _mortalis_."
> 
> "Entrega este mundo ao fogo que é seu direito de nascença, na forja do _Criador_-sob-a-Montanha. Deves perder tua criação para verdadeiramente entender o que significa criar."

**Termos utilizados:**

- _**Caelum:**_ "Céu" ou "paraíso". O fantasma se refere aos céus em seu sentido mais grandioso e astrológico.
- _**Ars:**_ "Arte" ou "habilidade". Para um romano, seria a palavra para uma arte ou ofício, mas aqui, ele a usa para se referir à Magia Hermética, a "Arte", como os próprios magos a chamam, criando uma ressonância fascinante.
- _**Mortalis:**_ "Mortal". Ele enfatiza a natureza humana e finita de Spatha em contraste com os poderes que ele busca.
- _**Creator:**_ "Criador" ou "Fazedor". Uma palavra poderosa e direta para descrever o papel do deus-ferreiro, seja ele Vulcano ou Hefesto.

**A Price for Passage:** The Redcap in charge of the chapter house, a grizzled veteran named **Gaspard**, greets them. The portal to Aedes Mercurii is active, but there is a complication. A recent magical surge has made the connection unstable. Gaspard needs a specially crafted silver and obsidian component to recalibrate the portal's matrix—a task perfectly suited for a Verditius magus. He has the raw materials but lacks the fine skill. Spatha must craft this component before he can travel, turning his final step into a small test of the very skills he seeks to have initiated.

**News and Whispers:** While waiting or working, Spatha and his companions will be privy to the gossip and news that flows through a Mercere House. They might overhear:
- Talk of rising tensions with the nobility in the eastern part of the Tribunal.
- A rumor of a powerful magical creature awakening in the Alps.
- A quiet warning about Ruberus, Spatha's initiator, mentioning his demanding nature or a recent strange obsession.

### 1. The Starmetal Spider (Idmon/Ninip)

**The Creature:** This is a magical spider, roughly the size of a man's palm. Its eight legs and cephalothorax are forged from a shimmering, dark metal that resembles a polished meteorite, and its abdomen is a sphere of captured night, swirling with miniature, glittering constellations. It is a natural artisan, a weaver of fate and light. Let us call it **Celeste**.

**The Eclipse Connection:** As the sky darkens and the stars make their brief, daytime appearance, a single, impossibly fine thread descends from the heavens. Spatha, observing the eclipse with a specially crafted lens, is the only one to notice this filament of solidified starlight. At the end of the thread is the Starmetal Spider, come to earth to repair a flaw in the terrestrial reflection of the celestial pattern—a task it can only perform when the sun's glare does not blind it.

**As a Familiar:**

- **Intelligence:** +2. Its mind is alien, mathematical, and patient. It thinks in terms of patterns, connections, and the cosmic geometry of fate. It communicates not with words, but by weaving intricate, temporary webs that form prophetic images or complex schematics.
- **Abilities:** Celeste's primary ability is its **Starlight Webbing**. This silk is an incredibly potent ingredient for enchantments, especially those involving astrology, scrying, light, or communication over distances (Intellego Vim/Imaginem). When used in Spatha's lab, it could provide a significant bonus to enchanting items with these properties. It also possesses an innate, deep knowledge of **Astrology** and **Magic Lore** (constellations, spirits).
- **Story Hooks:** The silk it produces is a unique and powerful resource that other magi, particularly other Verditius or specialists in scrying, would covet. The spider may have cosmic duties, occasionally compelling Spatha to embark on strange quests to "realign" a confluence of magic on Earth to match a celestial event.
