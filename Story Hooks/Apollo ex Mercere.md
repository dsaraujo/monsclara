Greetings, fellow Storyguide. It is a weighty and sorrowful task you set for young Apolo, to uncover the truth of his parens' demise. A quest for truth is often a journey into darkness, and the shadows surrounding the death of Ophilio ex Mercere 1 are deep indeed, for they are cast by one of the Tribunal's highest authorities, the Praeco Dama ex Merinita. 2

Here are some scenes and challenges you might weave into this dangerous investigation, drawing upon the chronicles of our saga.

### **Suggested Scenes**

**1. The Silent Sanctum: A Lack of Chaos**

Apolo's first act would surely be to gain access to his master's sanctum within Aedes Mercurii. The official story is a botched Longevity Ritual leading to Twilight. 3 Such an event, especially one powerful enough to claim a magus of Ophilio's age (172 years old), should leave potent magical residue.

- **The Clue:** The most damning evidence is what is _absent_. The sanctum is too clean. An Intellego Vim spell (perhaps _Sight of the Lingering Magic_) would reveal the traces of the powerful Longevity Ritual, but none of the chaotic, warping energies of a Twilight episode. The silence of the lab is louder than any scream.
- **Discovery:** In his master’s meticulous notes, Apolo might find the final entry: "_Preparing the final ritual for Dama ex Merinita. A fascinating case. Her familiar is… peculiar. It seems to watch me with an intelligence that belies its form._"
- **Physical Evidence:** Ophilio was a Longevity Specialist. 4 He would have demanded payment in vis. Perhaps a few pawns of vis Dama provided are left behind. If Apolo examines them, he may feel a faint, unnatural coldness—not of the Infernal, for Maju is skilled at hiding its nature5, but a wrongness that a Mercere, attuned to the flows of magic, might find disquieting.

**2. Whispers in the Hall of Mercury**

Aedes Mercurii is a covenant that politically opposes Castra Solis. 6 Apolo's investigation will not go unnoticed, and the magi within will have their own agendas.

- Pila, Flambeau
- **The Sage's Warning:** **Protendus ex Tremere**, being Reclusive and Secretive8, would avoid Apolo publicly. However, he might arrange a "chance" meeting in the library, slipping him a note that says, "_Not all who vanish enter Twilight. Some are pushed. Be wary of the Serpent, even when it looks like a dove._" This hints at Maju's shapeshifting ability. 9
- **The Diplomat's Plea:** **Ruberus ex Verditius** is Conciliatory and Relaxed. 10 He would urge caution, fearing that a direct accusation against the Praeco could ignite a war that would consume the Tribunal. "_Apolo, consider the consequences. To accuse the Praeco without undeniable proof is to invite ruin not just upon yourself, but upon this covenant._"

**3. The Serpent's Smile at Mimizan**

Sooner or later, Apolo must confront Dama herself. He might travel to Mimizan under the pretense of discussing his parens' last moments.

- **The Performance:** Dama, a Proud 11 and ancient maga, would receive him with perfect, sorrowful grace. She would recount a believable tale of a ritual going awry, of Ophilio's mind snapping under the strain. "_He was a dear friend,_" she might say, her voice full of feigned grief. "_It was a mercy, in the end. A quick passage into the Mystery is better than centuries of madness._"
- **The Familiar:** Throughout the meeting, her familiar, **Maju**, would be present. Perhaps it takes the form of a small, winged sprite that flits around the room, or a beautiful, patterned viper coiled on a cushion. It would watch Apolo with its ancient, malevolent intelligence, and Apolo might feel a disturbing sense of being measured and judged. Dama might even have Maju offer Apolo a cup of wine, a subtle act of dominance and threat.
- **The Test:** Dama might test Apolo with a subtle Mentem probe, looking for the extent of his suspicions. If his Parma Magica is strong, she will become more guarded. If weak, she may attempt to plant a seed of doubt or misdirection.

**4. Following the Thread of the Redcaps**

As a Mercere, Apolo's greatest weapon is information. He can call upon the network to uncover details others cannot.

- **The Vis Trail:** Where did Dama acquire the vis for the ritual? A Redcap like **Sera** 13131313 or **Berezi** 14 could be tasked with tracing the provenance of the vis, which could lead to a Faerie regio or a place with an Infernal aura.
    
- **Past Associates:** Dama trained **Marie ex Merinita**. 15 While Marie is unlikely to betray her parens, a careful conversation could reveal much. Does Marie seem fearful? Does she speak of Dama's familiar? Her reactions could be as telling as her words.
    
- **The Abbot's Chest:** The chronicles state that a Quaesitor named Senex ex Merinita was killed by Maju years ago near Mimizan 16161616, and another, Protantus, was murdered in a plot involving Garus ex Flambeau. 17 If Apolo learns of this pattern of dead investigators, he might seek out **Beatrice ex Guernicus** 18181818, the current Chief Quaesitor, who is already suspicious of this history. 191919

### **Challenges to Overcome**

**1. The Weight of Authority: Accusing the Praeco**

Dama is not merely a powerful maga; she is the Praeco of the Provençal Tribunal. 20 To accuse her is to accuse the law itself. Any official investigation would need the approval of the Chief Quaesitor, Beatrice, who knows this would fracture the Tribunal. 21 Apolo will face immense political pressure from all sides to drop his inquiry for the sake of "peace."

**2. A Deceitful Foe: The Duke of Hell**

Apolo believes he is investigating a magical accident or a simple murder. He is, in fact, facing a Duke of the False Gods. 22 Maju can actively sabotage the investigation.

- It can use its powers to create illusions, planting false clues to lead Apolo astray. 23
    
- It can whisper seeds of paranoia into the minds of Apolo's allies, turning them against him.
- It can use its _Obsession_ power to amplify Apolo's grief into a destructive vendetta, making him appear unstable and discredit his findings. 24
    
- It can frame Apolo for a crime, using its shapeshifting to appear as him while committing some breach of the Code. 25
    

**3. The Poisoned Chalice of Alliances**

The aid offered by Flammarcus and the anti-Castra Solis faction at Aedes Mercurii is a double-edged sword. 26 They will push Apolo to act recklessly, hoping to spark a conflict they can exploit. If he relies too heavily on them, he may find himself a mere pawn in their war, his quest for justice for his parens forgotten in the clash of covenants. He must navigate these political waters with the cunning of a Mercere, not the blind charge of a Flambeau.

May the path of inquiry be lit by wisdom for you and for Apolo. The truth he seeks may be more terrible than the lie he was told.
