## Heretics plot: Waldensians

Not all heretics deeply oppose the Church like the Cathars. Some accept it, and long only to reform it. Most important of these are the Waldensians. Despite their enthusiasm for reform, they often stray into heresy. They were popular preachers who translated the Bible into Occitan, but 1215 saw the Waldensians condemned as heretics, even though Pope Innocent III believed them “good Christians.” Waldensian characters may be modeled upon the Franciscans depicted in The Church, Chapter 8, as can their Dominican adversaries once they come to be organized in their efforts to convert back lost souls.

The Dominican Monastery of Saint-André-les-Alpes might not be happy with their presence.

They want to translate a copy of the Bible to Occitan, but their original copy was destroyed on their flight from the west.

Reinerius Saccho gave the following charges against the Waldensians:

- The Pope is the head of all errors
- The Monks are Pharisees
- Christians should obey God instead of the Prelates
- That no one is above one another in the church
- No one should kneel before a priest
- Tithes should not be given
- Bishops should not have royal rights
- They condemn the Catholic sacraments
- The Church has erred by prohibiting the marriage of the clergy
