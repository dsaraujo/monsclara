## Fairy Legends

**The Gévaudan**

Between 1764-1767, a mysterious wolf-like creature terrorized the region of Gévaudan. Accounts are brutal, describing numerous deaths, particularly children. The Beast became infamous, inspiring widespread fear and even intervention from the King of France. Its true nature remains debated - a monstrous wolf, a hybrid animal, or a trained killer?

**The Tarasque of Tarascon**

Summary: A dragon-like monster terrorized the town of Tarascon. St. Martha tamed the Tarasque with prayers and holy water. The creature became docile and was led back to the town where, in fear, the people killed it.

Story Potential: Modern-day twist! What if the Tarasque wasn't killed, just dormant? Perhaps construction in the area disturbs its lair. Or, could a reclusive descendant of the Tarasque exist, struggling with their nature against the backdrop of a summer festival celebrating the legend?

**The Drac**

The Legend: The Drac is a mischievous water spirit found throughout Occitan folklore. It can shapeshift, cause floods, lure children to rivers and play tricks with its power over water. It's often depicted as part-man, part-fish, sometimes even taking on draconic traits.

Quick idea

Chased by a knight that is seeking a new protector while traversing the Regio. They must avoid the chase of the horse.

**The Stuff of Dreams**

Dreams are qualitatively different from other mental states; while desire, sadness, or madness are clearly related to the humors as direct expressions of Mentem, the content of dreams is always the stuff of sensation, and therefore Imaginem. Hence to create, enter, or change a dream from outside one uses Mentem, but to enact changes within the dream one uses Imaginem.

Imaginem, not Mentem, is the success in the Dream world.

A magus preparing for dream travel may choose to extend his Parma Magica to cover his body and spirit as separate entities (using the rules in ArM5, page 66), reducing his effective Parma score by 3.
