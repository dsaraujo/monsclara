ExMiscellanea

Fazedor de Panelas e utensílios e afins

Rustic Magi

Aprendiz de Tres ex Miscellanea, que o atormenta.

Minha later life é super focada em craft e com puissant eu mostrei habilidades muito a frente da minha idade. Comecei trabalhando na oficina até o gift ser percebido quando ele deu atenção as coisas que eu tava fazendo

Durante o aprendizado eu casei e tive um filho, que me fez começar a questionar a belicosidade do Tres durante o aprendizado. Muitos dos itens que fiz foram usados na campanha dele

Quando passei pelo gauntlet, decidi acabar com a magia de todos os itens que havia feito pra ele (virtude harnessed Magic deixa fazer isso) e ele não gostou nem um pouco, minha família ainda era covenfolk dele e perdi o olho tentando defende-los da sua retaliação

O Olho da Drusilla é a personal vis font dela, ela vira e mexe chora com lembranças da família e de como foi impotente tentando parar o Tres e isso gera vis. O tipo de vis é dependente da memória

## Story

Tormenting Master: Tres ex Miscellanea

**Scene 1: Finding Drusilla (1204)**

Describe Tres band, a group of ragtag bunch of outcasts and opportunistic routiers from the northern armies. They are based in the Bordeaux area.

**Scene 2: The Attack of Mistridge (1209) Drusilla is 14.**

A massive group of over a hundred man, with magical catapults that easily crosses the forest nearby the covenant, and literally puts the building to the ground.

Rixenda of Mistridge, a Jerbiton, 34 (34) at the time, is able to escape using Wizard's Step and then Leap of Homecoming, barely accomplishing it. As a young mage, Tres do not worry. She will later move to Ostal del Exiles.

Tres also takes a small girl with him (Charlotte), a survival from the attack, which will be his next apprentice.

**Scene 3: The Trial of Tres (1214) (Drusilla is 19)**

During the Tribunal an attempt was made to bring charges against the magus Tres of Ex Miscellanea, who had armed a company of mercenaries with magical weapons claiming they were all his grogs, and employed them to destroy the covenant of Mistridge, leveling the magically conjured tower with magical siege artillery.

Despite the fact Tres’ actions were deplored by many, they were part of a justly declared Wizard’s War, and no ruling exists restricting the employment of grogs in the pursuit of such an action. The vote was narrowly in his favour, and Tres wisely fled in to hiding to escape the vengeance of the friends of Mistridge. The Quaesitor at the time was the urgently appointed Beatrice, since Senex was not the Tribunal. As part of his acquittal, he offers Drusilla to be raised by Marcella ex Bonisagus, since Giacoma is almost done with her training (she will soon be gauntlet, and quickly owe a large sum of vis to Rome, returning to Stella Durus).

**Scene 4: The attack of Drusillas family**

Charlotte está lá. Itens são destruídos.

## Mimizan

Dama wants to initiate Drusilla into her cult. Tibaut is suspicious of the circumstances of the previous Quaesitor Chief (Xavier?) and it is questioning the Praeco. He is getting close to the truth.

Three stories building, on the swampy coast. Faerie aura 4, Aegis 50 (+52), ReMe boundary effect with Pene +0.

Rebecca is a folk witch that lives with Dama.

Characters initiated into the first level are referred to privately as Sisters, and focus on interacting with the people of their communities, especially with non-magi. They must possess Organization Lore: Matres and Matrones 1, but there are no other requirements apart from the sacrifices inherent in the Initiation scripts. At this stage, women may be invited to initiate Venus’s Blessing, The Feminine Gift (see New Virtues on page 29), or The Gentle Gift, and must take an oath to protect other women from harm.

(Rebecca can initiate Feminine Gift, Dama Feminine Gift or Venus Blessing)
