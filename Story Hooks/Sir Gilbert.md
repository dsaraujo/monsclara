Knight looking for a dragon.

Met Benoit.

Was camping near the inn north to Castellane.

Was unaffected by Penelope spell to make him dream of his home due to its Magic Resistance 30.

Spring 1220 - His warhorse (Apollo, Expensive, £10) is turned into a frog by Luc ex Bjornaer, and then eaten. Sir Gilbert assumes that his horse was stolen, and fines the inn owner 10p, which he doesn't have, so he is sent to the dungeons of Briançonnet. His family is desperate now.

Without a horse, Sir Gilbert is not a full knight, and will go back to Folcalquier in the Summer of 1220 to procure a new one. It will take him 2 years to get back close to the covenant again.

Spring of 1222 - Sir Gilbert is back. He is recalled by the King for the Albegiense Crusade. He went hunting for the Drac, with many attempt to find the creature, and losing some men, but a bout of disease (a demon) brought him back home.

Around 1227 he travelled once again to Arelat in the search of the Dragon.
