## Overview

Barbegal was a Roman watermill complex that was used as a covenant site in the late ninth century by a trio of magi. One of the magi was a Verditius engineer who was rumored to have discovered how to extract different Forms of vis from Magic auras using magical waterwheels. The peaceful settlement was raided by Fraxinetum. The only surviving member of the covenant fled to join Coenobium. **The Barbegal complex retains a Magic aura of 5**. Barbegal is located a few miles north of Arles (moved to close to Barles )

Rogier ex Verditius was interested in Barbegal because he believed that it contained lost secrets of House Verditius. Rogier left the covenant when Tibaut published instructions on how to reach the location. Spatha read texts sent by Beatrice and was able to identify the location of the Barbegal covenant. Spatha learned from Marcela that she had visited the watermill next to the Barbegal covenant with Romulus ex Flambeau to try to rebuild the mill of stones, an item that Marcela believed was capable of creating vis of technique.
## Damocles

Carta de [Damocles of Jerbiton](Damocles%20of%20Jerbiton.md) para Spatha: 

 >Em relação a Rogier, ele lembra que ele leu sobre o covenant de Barbegal, um complexo com moinho dágua dominado por magos-ferreiros, todos Verditius, um pouco ao norte de Arles, que fora abandonado no começo do décimo século devido à ataques Sarracenos, e os magos sobreviventes ajudaram a fundar o Ceonobium. Rogier era um dos raros Verditius do tribunal e era muito curioso sobre Barbegal, acreditando que o local continha mistérios perdidos da casa Verditius. No entanto, ele deixou o covenant quando Tibaut ex Guernicus publicou notas com instruções específicas para chegar no local num tratado sobre Fraexinetum e os ataques Sarracenos buscando o local. Isso aconteceu em 1204, dezesseis anos atrás. Rogier é considerado como um magi que abandonou o tribunal e nunca mais deu notícia.
## Faith and Flame

A few miles north of Arles lie the ruins of a Roman watermill complex once used as a covenant site in the late ninth century by a trio of magi. One of the magi was a Verditius engineer rumored to have discovered a way to extract different Forms of vis from Magic auras using magical waterwheels.

The peaceful settlement suffered the depredations of Fraxinetum (see earlier). Its sole surviving member fled to join the nascent Coenobium. The Barbegal complex retains a Magic aura of 5.

AKA *Steinbock*

The wild **Goat of Virtue** is the best climber of all the beasts and its eyesight is so keen it can distinguish hunters from simple travelers at a great distance. The he-goat is so full of lust that its blood is hot enough to dissolve even diamond.

Powers:
*Healing*, 3 points, Init –8, Animal
R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind
The stag can heal one of its own Heavy or lesser wounds. This is a Restricted Power: the stag must eat the herb dittany to activate it.
CrAn 25 (Base effect): Ritual Power (25 levels), Improved Powers (2 mastery point, –2 Might cost)

*Delay the Serpent’s Venom*, 0 points, Init n/a, Aquam
R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind
The Stag of Virtue is magically warded against poison. Any poison introduced into the Stag’s body takes no effect until the next sunrise or sunset (whichever comes first). This power activates whenever such a poison is introduced, and thus has an Intellego requisite.
Re(In)Aq 20 (Base 5, +2 Sun, +1 Intellego requisite): Personal Power (20 levels, –1 Might cost), Improved Powers (1 mastery point, –1 Might cost) 

*Alleviate the Serpent’s Bite*, 1 point, Init +1, Aquam

PeAq 15 (Base 15): Personal Power (15 levels, +1 Initiative, –1 Might cost) 

Vis: 3 Creo in right antler. This is spell-like (see Chapter 8: Magic Things, Spell-Like Vis) with an effect similar to Restoration of the Defiled Body (ArM5, page 129).

A Stag of Virtue is a great enemy of serpents and kills them whenever it can. It does this by filling its mouth with water and spitting it down the serpent’s hole; when the serpent emerges to escape drowning, the Stag of Virtue tramples it to death. 
A Stag of Virtue enjoys vigorous health and can live a very long time (in fact, like other Beasts of Virtue, it can live forever). To keep itself youthful and healthy, this stag swallows a live, venomous serpent. Then it drinks a large quantity of water to neutralize the venom. After this process, its antlers fall off and its vigor is restored. Hermetic experts concur that the Stag of Virtue actually consumes Magical serpents for this process and that it becomes weak and looks aged when it cannot find snakes to eat (such as during the winter). The Stag of Virtue lives only in places where Magical snakes can be found.
The right antler of a Stag of Virtue has healing powers and is greatly sought by hedge wizards and magi alike. The stag always buries its antlers after shedding them. Anyone who consumes the flesh of a Stag of Virtue gains a Lesser Immunity to fevers for Moon duration. The stag itself is immune to fevers and the venison transfers this immunity through the Law of Contagion.
The right antler of a Stag of Virtue may be Enriched by carving it into a cup, which every day for a season is filled with the blood and powdered skull of a viper. If filled with clear spring water with a leaf of dittany (a Necessary Condition), the cup neutralizes any poison (Greater Purifying Touch (Poison))

**The regio entrance**

The entrance of the regio is inside the river. The main difference inside the regio is the Aura (Magical 5), and the addition of the main covenant building, a huge perfectly circular tower (likely built by Creo Terram), with a massive water mill and an observatory at the top.

There are marks of destruction around the tower, but the tower itself is intact. Fraxinetum never destroyed the tower, but the the destruction of the village and resources was enough to move the magi out.

### Inside the Covenant

#### Magi of Barbegal

* Homero ex Verditius, granparens of Rotgiers ex Verditius, astrologist and researcher of the skies (Sigil: The constelation of Aries)
* Rotula ex Verditius, student of techniques and forms (and main creator of the magical Mill) (Sigil: Wheels and Rotation)
* Sellena ex Verditius, parens of Selen of Verditius, from Mons Clara. (Sigil: Marble). Specialist in Terram, especially Marble and Stone based.

#### Timeline

896 - Barbegal Founded
973 - Destruction of Barbegal
975 - Sellena is the only survival of the Fraexinetum attack and moves to Cenobium.
1050 - Sellena takes Selen as her apprentice
1076 - Sellen ex Verditius joins Mons Clara
1146 - Sellen ex Verditius left for Castra Solis to work on arming Hoplites, never came back.
1187 - Sellen dies.
1204 - Rogiers investigates Barbegal, and got killed 

#### The Old Forge
Pretty abandoned at this point. It is unique as it incorporate various techniques: metal forging, sculpting, gear making, glassblowing, carpentry and cloth making. There is a display, mostly empty. The main anvil is enchanted to repair itself at sunset and sunrise (it is the only item to be pristine). It is an effect of MuTe 20 similar to _Edge of the Razor_, and provides a £4 savings for a covenant operations.

There is still a storage of vis, mostly stored in metal gears, mostly spread over, total below:
* 4 Terram
* 10 Vim
* 6 Rego

4 Terram e 6 Vim encontrados.
#### The Sick Mermaid
Helena took a place near the mill, but got hurt. She was "healed" with _Bind Wounds_ and left for the sea, searching her sisters.

![](Sereia.png)
#### Rogiers of Verditius

Died trying to move stones. He botched a ReTe spell, got crushed by a giant stone (the animal stone) and got killed. He still carries his casting tools, a long collection of metal rings in a metal collar. He still has his talisman, a device that looks like a mix of a crowbar and hammer, with a back that looks like a chisel. 

#### The Three Sanctums

**Sellena**: left a construct, an owl made of Marble. Her name is Hoot (Sellena had a strange sense of humor)

Might: 12
Angelic Movement Cr(Re)Au 40
Identify Stones InTe 30
She can also identify precious gemstones and sort them. InTe 40
It is severely damaged and broken, with only 5 might remaining. I can be repaired with a Int + Craft Automata + stress vs. 18 check per 1 Might, or a full season if Re(Me)Te > 15

**Homero**: All the planetary markings and details allows someone to independently research Planetary Magic. It requeres a full season of study, in which the researchers has to roll a **Stress Die + Intelligence + Artes Liberales (Astronomy)** versus 18. Each subsequent season of study reduces the ease factor by one. Magi can do this research outside of his lab, but incur a -3 penalty on the roll. Homero sanctum and lab are heavily influenced by Vim and his lab has a high Warping Score. Each season spent here gives a single warping point and might affect the magi (as he gain a minor flaw once learning planetary magic)

![](Clock_of_San_Marco_clockface.png)

**Rotula**: The  missing stone (Ignem). The other stones are in the mill, and one of stones (Vi) are still in Mons Clara. This gathers all 10 stones which allows using the mill stones to be used to distill vis and obtain any form as result. Techniques can be done too as a continuation of this research.

A rare book is stored here: Summa Auram L11, Q19; Soaring Winds, by Weston ex Verditius. Weston is grandparent of Rotula. The book is slightly damaged with -1 Quality, but it can be repaired.

## The master Mole

### The Fugitive: Esther de Foix

The Cathar who stumbles into the ruins of Barbegal is not a man, but a woman named **Esther de Foix**. She is a _perfecta_, one of the spiritual elite of the Cathar faith, in her late 40s. Her face is etched with weariness and sorrow, but her eyes hold a serene, unwavering light.

**Her Backstory:** Esther was a respected leader in a small, hidden community of believers near the town of Arles. She is a woman of great learning and compassion, known for her healing hands (mundane, not magical) and her soothing sermons that speak of a world free from the corruption of the flesh. Her family has historical ties to the nobility of the region who have long been sympathetic to the Cathar cause, which has made her a person of some significance.

Her community was recently betrayed. A traveling merchant, whom they had aided, sold information of their location to the crusaders. The subsequent raid was brutal and swift. Esther only escaped because two of her flock sacrificed themselves to create a diversion, urging her to flee and keep their faith alive. She has been on the run for three days, wounded, exhausted, and hunted. She was drawn to the ancient, secluded nature of Barbegal, crossing a regio portal by mistake, hoping to find a place to rest and tend to a festering gash on her leg before seeking a new, safe haven.

### The Hunter: Sir Guilhem de Montpeyroux, "The Scourge of Heretics"

Pursuing Esther is **Sir Guilhem de Montpeyroux**, a landless knight from northern France who has joined the Crusade with fervent zeal. He is a grim, imposing figure in his mid-30s, his surcoat adorned with a stark black cross. He is not a simple brute; he is cunning, patient, and utterly convinced of the righteousness of his cause. He sees the Cathars not as misguided souls, but as a cancerous blight that must be purged with fire and steel.

He is not acting alone. Sir Guilhem is loosely attached to the forces of the Inquisition in Arles and has been given a small retinue of three hardened sergeants-at-arms to aid his "holy work." He has earned the grim moniker "The Scourge" for his relentless and brutal efficiency in tracking down and eliminating Cathar fugitives. He tracked Esther's community for weeks and now, having found their nest, is determined to capture the _perfecta_ to make a public example of her. He believes her capture and execution will earn him favor, land, and, most importantly in his eyes, a place in heaven. His men are currently sweeping the countryside between Arles and the Alpilles mountains, and their search is drawing ever closer to the ruins of Barbegal.
