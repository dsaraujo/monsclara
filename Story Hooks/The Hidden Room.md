**A Window of Singular Direction (Lv 14 MuTe)** 
A text lab for an item, a small rock, with the following enchantment:

The Disappearance of the Rock (MuTe 10)
R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind
This spell removes the property of visibility from 10 cubic paces of stone near the rock, which can be affixed by clay.
(Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Size, +1 Stone)

Material: Small granite pebble (hard stone, 4, tiny, x1)
Effect Modifications: Constant Effect +4
Final effect level: 14, 2 vis of Terram instilled.

The pebble itself does not turn itself invisible, and very often is positioned at the base of the "window". The user of the item can try to shape the "window" with a Finesse roll, but a botch in the roll will likely create an unusable shape.
