Example folios

Over the course of seven years, the Colentes Arcanorum (see HoH:TL 10-11) receive between fifteen and thirty Lab Texts and tractatus submitted for consideration in the next Folio. At their meeting, held at an agreed-upon Regional Tribunal, the five members of the Colentes Arcanorum decide what will be included and what will not. "Only the best material is used. Unimaginative or routine Lab Texts are passed over, as are low Quality Tractatus or those on uninteresting subjects." Original research and Lab Texts that include experimentation are valued. Well-written tractatus are useful, but Lab Texts are preferred. "New spells and magic items are interesting, but the emphasis is on knowledge that pushes the boundaries of Hermetic magic."
