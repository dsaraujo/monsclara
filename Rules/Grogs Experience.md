XP per year working two seasons:
4xp practice -> 8xp/year

Assuming starting at age 10:

Ability, time to level, acc total time, Grog avg age
0->1: 1 year (1), 11
1->2: 1 year (2), 12
2->3: 2 years (4), 14
3->4: 4 years (8), 18
4->5: 4 years (12), 22
5->6: 4 years (16), 26
6->7: 6 years (24), 34
7->8: 10 years (34), 44
8->9: 10 years (44), 54 (retired)
9->10: 16 years (60), 70 (unlikely without longevity ritual)

Typically, Grogs retire with a max 8 in their main ability. Reduce by 2 if a Grog have many abilities (like a Shield Grog leader, or a teacher of multiple skills), add +2 if a Grog would be particularly talented (puissant).

Determining a Grog intellegence:

- Botch = Learning disabilities
- 0 = -3
- 2 = -2
- 3-4 = -1
- 5-7 = +0
- 8-9 = +1
- 10 = +2
- 11+ = +3
