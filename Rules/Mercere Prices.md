## Lab Texts

For game purposes, spells are broadly divided into three categories: Common, Uncommon, and Rare.

Common spells include all spells in the Ars Magica core book. They cost 1 pawn for every 75 levels of effect.

Spells located in other official products, and which are not considered exclusive to their creators or House, are considered uncommon. These spells cost 1 pawn for every 15 levels of effect.

And spells which do not appear in official sources, or which are exclusive to their creators or their House, are considered rare. The purchaser is probably negotiating with the creator of the spell. The cost of these spells is determined on a case by case basis with low level spells being cheapest (about 1 pawn for every 5 levels) and high level ones being most expensive (1 pawn for every level of the effect).

## Services

Ophilio ex Mercere é um dos magos mais antigos do tribunal, com 172 (85) anos em 1220. Ele provavelmente vai morrer nos próximos 20-30 anos, mesmo com seu ritual de -18, já rola com -1 e pode ter crises.

Ele oferece rituais para os Mercere de graça, com um modificador de -15, e cobra das outras casas em troca. Ele faz suas pesquisas nas outras estações. Ele cobra 15p pelo ritual, mas o difícil é entrar na lista. A lista com frequencia bumps pessoas um ano no futuro devido à crises dos magi mais velhos.

- 1220 - Garsenda ex Tremere (Ostal des Exiles)
- 1221 - Reserved
- 1222 - Beatrice ex Guernicus (Castra Solis)
- 1223 - Reserved
- 1224 - Free
- 1225 - Antoinette of Jerbiton (Bellaquin)
- 1226 - Giacoma ex Bonisagus (Stella Durus)
- 1227 - Booked
- 1228 - Booked
- 1229 - Booked
- 1230 - Livia ex Bonisagus filia Aurelia (Ceonobium)
- 1231 - Tres apprentice
- 1232+ - Free

Outros magos oferecem o serviço também (como Siggurd em Ceonobium), oferecendo um total de Lab de 40 + ajuda(se quiser) por 8pawns.


## Letters
Letters are delivered and received in:

**Same year**: Ceonobium, Mercer House, Bjornaer gathering, Glanum, Aedes Mercurii, Harco, Domus Magnas and/or Mercer Portal connected

**Next year**: all other Provençal covenants, Covenants in Normandy, Alps and Iberia

**Two years:** almost all other covenants served by the red caps network

## Procuring Items/Services

## Locating an Item or Service

Roll to find someone with the desired thing: **Intrigue+Communication+Highest Reputation vs. Rarity** (see below)

The logic being that this is kind of a specialized gossip roll (covered by intrigue) through the redcaps/correspondence. Higher reputation magi with more clout have an easier time of this.

You can do it once per season without causing a distraction. Dedicating a season to the activity should improve chances or allow more tries possibly.

## Bartering

If you succeed you find somebody with the thing you want. At this point the storyguide can name a suitable NPC/covenant for you to barter with as a story, or you can abstract that using the following roll:

Roll to acquire the item (generic): **Bargain+Communication+Modifiers vs Stress Die+3**

or

Roll to acquire the item (seller known): **Bargain+Communication+Modifiers vs Seller’s Bargain+Com+Highest Reputation**

The former roll is more abstract, the second assumes you have a statted NPC and just abstracts the negotiations.

Modifiers/bonuses are at the discretion of the storyguide for now (may flesh this out more later). Etiquette may come into play here.

A botch means they refuse to sell, a story may be warranted to resolve this.

Failure means they will trade/sell, but only in exchange for another resource the PC lacks (e.g. Robertus has an emerald of virtue and is willing to trade it to Alicia, but not for vis - he will only accept a dragon's tooth, which he needs for an experiment).

Success means they will trade it for a fair price (worked out via build points etc.)

## Item/Service Rarity

This is a very first draught idea of how hard the rolls for different things might be IMS. Obviously the rarity of different things is very saga dependent.

|**Rarity**|**Ease Factor**|**Example (IMS)**|
|---|---|---|
|Universal|Automatic Success|Mundane materials found in the local area, Normal tools and equipment|
|Common|3|Normal mundane materials not found in the local area, Specialist tools and equipment (e.g. standard lab fittings, glassmaking equipment, surgical tools)|
|Uncommon|6|Unusual mundane materials (e.g. lion’s blood, Cappadocian salt), Unusual tools and equipment (e.g. alchemical equipment, fittings for a specialist lab, equipment not normally available in nearby tribunals), Someone willing to make a straightforward enchanted item or spell, A lab text for a ubiquitous spell (e.g. Pilum of Fire, Aegis of the Hearth)|
|Scarce|9|Things of virtue which are found naturally in the nearby tribunals, Exotic tools and equipment (i.e. mundane equipment that is only found outside of Mythic Europe), The location of a common beast of virtue (i.e. which is found naturally in the nearby tribunals), Normal vis in a particular form (e.g apples which contain vis), Someone willing to make an enchanted item or spell that requires a specific mystery or is moderately complex, A lab text for a common spell (any spell listed in core rulebook, plus other suitable spells at the Storyteller’s discretion)|
|Rare|12|Things of virtue which are not found naturally in the nearby tribunals but are found in the territory of the order, The location of an unusual beast of virtue (i.e. which cannot be found naturally in the nearby tribunals but can be found somewhere in Mythic Europe), Someone willing and able to make a very powerful or unusual enchanted item or spell, A lab text for an obscure spell|
|Unique|15|Things of virtue which can only be found outside the territory of the order, Someone willing to make an enchanted item or spell that requires original research, The location of a unique beast of virtue (i.e. which can only be found naturally outside of Mythic Europe), A lab text for a forbidden/banned spell|
